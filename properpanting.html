<p align="center" class="style6">PROPER PANTING</p>
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans didn&rsquo;t  always wear pants.&nbsp; Early man lacked the sharp tools and techniques  necessary for turning organic material into woven cloth.&nbsp; Without keys,  wallets and cell phones early humans had no need for pockets or pants in which  to place those pockets.&nbsp; A thick layer of hair was all the heat insulation  those humans needed.&nbsp; Eventually humans stood straighter, hair became  thinner and thinner, technology and necessity converged and the first pant was  born.<br />
      <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first pants were crude, to say the  least.&nbsp; In the tropical climates of southeast Asia, in what is now  Indonesia, early humans used fish skins to create elaborately patterned  trousers.&nbsp; Entire halves of tuna and mackerel would be skinned and their  tough exteriors cleaned and sewn together to create a spectacular precursor to  the well-known herringbone pattern of today.&nbsp; Silk and spice traders  brought word of these new types of durable leg coverings and in Europe  craftsmen and women began using sheep and lamb skins to make durable  bottomwear.&nbsp; Later innovators used the intestines and stomachs of the same  animals to fashion the first overalls, or as they were known in Bavaria,  &ldquo;&Uuml;beralles.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who could afford pants generally owned two  pairs: one for everyday; for work, and one that was never worn except to be  buried in.&nbsp; These &ldquo;death pants&rdquo;, as they were known, were similar to  normal pants except for one difference; the backside was cut out.&nbsp; The  early tailors of Europe were largely members of a now extinct religion that  believed the soul escaped through the ass after a person died.&nbsp; Being  buried in pants without an ass-scape hatch guaranteed that the soul would be  stuck in rectal purgatory.&nbsp; Tailored pants remained a luxury through the  middle ages and the higher up you wore your pants, the higher your social  position.&nbsp; The Hapsburgs all wore trousers up to their nipples. Those that  could only afford one pair of pants or no pants at all made due with their  creativity.&nbsp; A burlap sack of flour?&nbsp; A durable, albeit incredibly  itchy, bottom layer.&nbsp; In the vast forests of northern of Scandinavia, pine  branches were woven together to protect the legs.<br />
     <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, modern manufacturing techniques have led to  the relative depreciation in the value of pants.&nbsp; Most people have several  pairs, in different materials, colors and patterns.&nbsp; Nobody would mistake  you for royalty if you casually mentioned that you got a new pair of  slacks.&nbsp; But with ubiquity comes disregard.&nbsp; Now that anyone with 10  bucks can have a decent pair of corduroys, people don&rsquo;t take as much care in  the appearance of their pants.&nbsp; Jeans are left to dissolve on the body of  their wearer, threads stretched across knees and thighs, barely holding  intact.&nbsp; Sweatpants at all hours of the day and in any setting.&nbsp; But  the worst and most egregious misuse of pants is the unreasonably popular  practice of sagging.<br />
  <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those unfamiliar with this term, sagging is  when a young man will wear his pants far below the waist they were intended to  hug, so far that his underwear is exposed for any unsuspecting onlooker.&nbsp;  When I see a young man, underwear exposed and loosely bunched between his  waistband and the under part of his ass cheeks, I wonder; where has  civilization failed this potential gentleman?&nbsp; At what point was he given  the impression that presenting his backside to the world in this way was a good  idea?&nbsp; Are images on television to blame?&nbsp; Or magazines?&nbsp;  Perhaps those saggy panted hip-hop artists are promoting this idea that  ill-fitting pants are de riguer?&nbsp; If this problem were limited to one  demographic of people, maybe there would be an easy culprit to identify.&nbsp;  From my research, however, there seems to be no sub-set of the population not  affected by this scourge.&nbsp; Pants, it should go without saying, ought to  fit the wearer.&nbsp; It's called a waistband for a reason, people!&nbsp; If  you are out for an evening stroll and notice a soft breeze tickling your  tuchus, your pants are sagging, Jack, and it's time to get a belt and get that  gabardine up above your butt.&nbsp; Now doesn't that feel better?&nbsp; Of  course it does.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of sagging pants are  jeans.&nbsp; Ever since Levi and Strauss introduced their durable denim to  frontiersmen of the west, jeans have been growing in popularity.&nbsp; Now  jeans are the go-to for millions of Americans.&nbsp; Besides looking shabby  saggy jeans prevent the aspiring gentleman from performing innumerable tasks  that would result in his personal betterment.&nbsp; If you're worried about  your pants falling down around your ankles, will you be able to confidently  stride up to a lovely woman on the street and ask her for a moment of her  time?&nbsp; Will you be able to help a nice young woman in your apartment  building get a table in and out of the elevator?&nbsp; Will you be able to  chase that bus to get to your appointment on time?&nbsp; The answer to all  three of these questions is, emphatically, no.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your pants should be the last thing you worry about and  they should only come down when you want them to, not because you raised your  hand to hail a cab.&nbsp; Proper panting is, in essence, wearing pants that fit  you.&nbsp; Wearing your jeans above your ass and keeping your underwear  undercover.&nbsp; But proper panting isn't just about the physical appearance  of your jeans, slacks, trousers, or kilt.&nbsp; Proper panting is having the  balls to zip up, button up, throw a belt around your waist and tell the world,  &quot;I'm a motherfucking gentleman.&quot;</p>
