  <p align="center" class="style6">FLANUERISM</p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Flanuer&rdquo;,  a French word meaning stroller, saunterer or loafer comes from the verb, also  French, &ldquo;flaner&rdquo; meaning, &ldquo;to stroll.&rdquo;&nbsp;  The word &ldquo;flaneur&rdquo; was popularized by Charles Beaudelaire, who developed  a derived meaning, that of&nbsp; &ldquo;a person who  walks the city in order to experience it.&rdquo;&nbsp;  Charlie Beau, as his closest friends called him, was already in his  thirties when Georges-Eug&egrave;ne Haussmann, during Napoleon III&rsquo;s &ldquo;Second Empire,&rdquo;  built the grand boulevards of Paris we know today.&nbsp; The grand boulevards helped create a more  beautiful and sanitary city and would make it much easier to move troops and  artillery around (see WWs I+II).&nbsp; The  city was opened up and was now highly strollable. Beaudelaire would vomit in  disgust if he saw the sorry state of strolling in the States.<br />
    <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today very few of us get around  without an automobile.&nbsp; Many supposed  gentlemen are quick to pipe up &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive!&rdquo; when a plan for an outing is  formed.&nbsp; For those without cars, the  feeling of being a second-class citizen is close to the surface.&nbsp; All over television there are ads for cars,  full of images extolling the freedom and excitement that car ownership  brings!&nbsp; You can load all your mp3s onto  your navigation system and use your 12 cupholders to hold every variety of  coffee Starbucks brews!&nbsp; There is no need  to leave your car ever again because along with these conveniences your  internal combustion engine is equipped with a refrigerated glove box and 4 dvd  players plus 16 speakers and don&rsquo;t forget the automated rear lift-gate, should  you be tempted to actually extend and contract a muscle group.&nbsp; You car will parallel park for you!&nbsp; Tell it you&rsquo;re hungry and it maps the route  to the nearest Chili&rsquo;s, where you can pick up your pre-frozen entr&eacute;e without  ever leaving your climate-controlled exoskeleton.<br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a real, 21st century  gentlemen knows is that we, especially those of us who live in urban  environments, have strayed too far from the simple pleasures embodied by the  idea of the flaneur.&nbsp; When Beaudelaire,  or Henry Miller or Ernest Hemingway wanted to get across town they did it in a  fashion that allows for interaction.&nbsp;  Walking, bicycling, trolley, subway, bus, even a moped or scooter, these  forms all allow us to see and be seen.&nbsp;  To let the sun hit our face and the wind blow sand into our mouths.&nbsp; We may spit and gag a little, but isn&rsquo;t that  what makes being alive wonderful?&nbsp;  Thinking &ldquo;Did I just swallow a bug?&nbsp;  Oh well, a little bug never hurt anyone&hellip;.Or did it?&nbsp; Why yes, I remember reading about that spider  that laid eggs in that gentleman&rsquo;s handkerchief and when he went to discreetly  blow his nose, the eggs were inhaled and into his lungs and the eggs hatched  and spiders filled his trunk&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you confine yourself to a car,  you lose some of your humanity.&nbsp; Sealed  in behind shatter-proof glass and sound-insulated doors, how can you complement  a fellow gentleman on his pocket square or slowly gaze from behind sunglasses  at the back of a young lady&rsquo;s thigh as it is revealed when a brisk wind lifts  the hem of her skirt ever so slightly and she doesn&rsquo;t notice because she is  talking on her cell phone while carrying bags from shopping?&nbsp; Yelling through your open window at the  gentleman?&nbsp; Why, you could startle him  and cause him to trip, sending him tumbling into some puddle of filth.&nbsp; And the young lady?&nbsp; You should be keeping your eyes on the road,  sir!&nbsp; If instead of driving you were  walking or cycling, you could pause and in a graceful move excuse yourself and  pay your compliment to the gentleman, or act as if you are confused as to what  street you&rsquo;re on, all the while appreciating the shape and fine adornment of  the young lady&rsquo;s leg.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By eschewing 4-wheel transport for  2-wheel and foot transport, you open yourself up to a vibrant world of  street-level life.&nbsp; Outdoor caf&eacute; diners&rsquo;  plates are now only feet from your nose and mouth.&nbsp; Flowers in outdoor racks tempt you with their  fragrance, &ldquo;my sweetheart would love a few lilies for her bedroom&hellip;.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this way you stay connected to the city  and its people.&nbsp; You overhear the  conversations and idle chatter of fellow strollers, moving slowly or quickly if  you want, not forced to keep up with the traffic.&nbsp; Try ditching your car for a week, for a  month.&nbsp; Then see if you&rsquo;re life has  become any worse.&nbsp; My guess, dear  readers, is that it will become better in ways you couldn&rsquo;t have imagined.&nbsp; </p>
