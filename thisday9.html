  <p align="center" class="style5">9.8.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">She woke up later in the morning. 11. She showered and shaved. Her phone rang while she was getting dressed but she did not pick up. She made two phone calls. One to her mother and the other to her girlfriend. She played records most of the afternoon. A variety of upbeat electronic music. She wrote a list because it made her feel organized. Chances are she would lose the list. She packed a suitcase and overnight bag. She flys often and has learned how to become smug and avoid conversation. She truly likes to travel alone. Her flight leaves at 10:30 tonight.</p>

  <p align="center" class="style9">THE EARTH</p>
  <p align="left" class="style9">The green earth has yielded<br />
    to everything yellow, gold, harvests,<br />
    farms, leaves, grain,<br />
    but when autumn rises<br />
    with its spacious banner<br />
    it is you that I see,<br />
    for me it is your hair<br />
    that seperates the tassels.<br />
  <br />
    I see the monuments<br />
    of ancient broken stone,<br />
    but if I touch<br />
    the stone scar<br />
    your body respnds to me,<br />
    my fingers recognize<br />
    suddenly, shivering,<br />
    your warm sweetness.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style9">I pass among the heroes<br />
    recently decorated<br />
    by earth and dust<br />
    and behind them, silent,<br />
    with your tiny steps,<br />
    is it you or not you?<br />
    Yesterday, when they pulled up<br />
    by the roots, to have a look at it,<br />
    the old dwarf tree,<br />
    I saw you come out looking at me<br />
    from the tortured and thirsty roots.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style9">And when sleep comes <br />
    to stretch me out and take me<br />
    to my own silence<br />
    there is a great white wind<br />
    that destroys my sleep<br />
    and from it fall leaves,<br />
    they fall like knives<br />
    upon me, draining me of blood.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style9">And each wound has<br />
    the shape of your mouth.</p>

  <p align="center" class="style2">&quot;I have to support myself. I have to pay for my apartment. I have to pay for food. People root for me and say they want me to work, but then everyone's against me.&quot;<br />

  <p align="center" class="style5">9.17.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">We (that's me, Greece-T and Janks) are on the wall to the left of the main stairwell. From behind, someone whispers down the hall toward us, firm, <em>call becky, call her now</em>.<br />
    Becky was tall. A funny girl. Always twirling her gum.<br />
    I could hardly understand how she would come to play in this underdeveloped notion of a crime. We have a job to do and...well...No...no, just count me out.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">9.20.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">People go to the cinema without knowing which movie they want to watch.</p>

    Check along the carpet for cables.<br />
    Bring the punch.<br />
    Battletoads.<br />
    Sugar Cane.<br />
    I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">9.22.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">I am really sad.<br />
    My left knee hurts pretty bad.<br />
    I am having trouble remembering things that matter.<br />
    Her voice, I can't hear.<br />
    A gramophone filled with dirt.<br />

  <p align="center" class="style5">9.23.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">The locomotive uses ten percent less energy.<br />
    After lunch in Marseilles, we take the night train to Berlin.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">9.24.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style10"> Mo money, mo murder, mo homicide.<br />
    You catch that body nigga, better have that alibi.<br />
    You never know, it might just be your time you take your ride.<br />
    To them pearly white gates, now watch that suicide.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">9.27.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">The Pentagon turntables are now sitting at the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay. These machines were designed by Bell Labs but created by funk, back when funk meant fear, German transmitters and codebreakers under headphones. The turntable played 16-inch records of thermal noise in reverse, a randomized shush, backwards masked inside out. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Produced by the Muzak Corporation, the vinyl was deployed for the army's &quot;Secret Telephony&quot; voice security system, a technology that was treated with the same crypto fuss as the Manhattan Project. Installed across the globe from 1943 to 1945, these fify-five ton phone scramblers would be used for D-Day, the Allied invasion of Germany, the bombing of Hiroshima, and the &quot;dismemberment of the surrender instrument&quot;---allowing Roosevelt, Truman, Churchill and Eisenhower to discuss the world's fate with voices they barely recognized, voices not human but polite artifical pulses 20 milliseconds in length.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">The wall of knobs assigned this task was the vocoder, a massive walk-in closet of cryptology invented by Bell Labs in 1928. The vocoder divided the voice into its consituent frequencies, spread across ten channels, and transmitted them through band pass filters. At the receiving end, this electronic impression of human speech: a machine's idea of the voice as imagined by phoentic engineeers. Not speech, they qualified, but a &quot;spectral description of it.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">The vocoder was sensitive, high maintenance and seven feet tall, an overheated room full of capacitors, vacuum tubes and transformers. Some engineers dubbed this system &quot;the Green Hornet.&quot; Others called it &quot;Special Customer.&quot; Bells Labs referred to it as Project X-61753, or &quot;X-Ray,&quot; as if it was ordered from the back of a comic book with a pair of rubber Mad Doctor Hands. The U.S. Signal Corps called it SIGSALY, taken from children's &quot;nonsense syllables&quot; and used for strategizing Allied bombing campaigns. The <em>New York Times</em>, not knowing what to call it, went with &quot;Machine that Tears Speech to Pieces,&quot; and then later, like most everybody else, decided on &quot;the robot.&quot;</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">Jenny sank her feet into the sand. The heat from the surface was too much. The cool grains filled the space between her toes. She had on red shorts that accented the beauty of her curves. Her top lay beside her towel. Pepperoni's basking, the sun drove her complexion to further perfection. She smiled because  she did not think, but knew, she was happy.</p>
