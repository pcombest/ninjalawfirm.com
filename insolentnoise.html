  <p align="center" class="style5">CLARKS DESERT BOOT</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Darkness.&nbsp;  Intolerable.&nbsp; Imperceptible.&nbsp; A bloody nuisance.&nbsp; What's worse is the headache, no doubt precipitated  by the irksome pressure politely issued by the blindfold.&nbsp; If I had a say in this pickle, I'd demand to  see the trainers on the imbecile who tied it; I'll wager he's the inferior  breed - the breed that constructs knots when the time comes to lace up.&nbsp; Plebeians, the lot. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I'm sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in what I can only surmise  is the soiled cabin of a prisoner transport vehicle.&nbsp; The chap to my left prays fearfully to his  creator.&nbsp; His Cairene come out stammered,  fused with pathetic, gutless bursts of the boo-hoos.&nbsp; Get a hold of yourself, man - we're only en  route to our execution.&nbsp; This poor  bastard needs some Keynes in his life:</p>
  <p align="center" class="style21">&lsquo;The long run is a  misleading guide to current affairs.&nbsp; In  the long run we are all dead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center" class="style7">- John Maynard Keynes, economist, 1st Baron Keyenes of  Tilton.&nbsp; Father of the soon-to-be-late  Roger O.&nbsp; Thornhill. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Okay, so he wasn't the real patriarch of the Thornhill family,  but I'd like to think so; my true originator was a drunk, failed pugilist, one  vainglorious womanizer and a loathsome thief who departed this world with  outstanding debts, leaving behind an irrational bitch of a wife and a squadron  of pugnacious misfits and scalawags, including yours truly.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">We decelerate as the road beneath devolves; pavement becomes  dirt, rocks - a bumpy bloody jaunt.&nbsp;  Heavy winds assault the cabin, whipping mercilessly against our  conveyance - that's Egyptian desert I smell, gusting through the ducts  above.&nbsp; I feel the chap beside me begin  to tremble, I smell the poor bastard wetting his trousers.&nbsp; We must be close. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">The barrel of a Kalashnikov nudges me on my feet - its  possessor's breath only intensifies the sweltering heat.&nbsp; I land the dirt, the crepe soles of my  teak-toned Clark&rsquo;s Desert Boots cushion my fall.&nbsp; Nine perilous years old and going  strong.&nbsp; Name another boot with the same  durability as the perennial brand of English-powered trekkers and you too could  be the proud owner of the UK's 35th largest (private) firm.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I'm walking blind, surrounded by the grunts, groans, prayers  and sobs of my fellow captives - The Reaper has come to collect and his  offerings are beginning to lose it.&nbsp; What  little fear that twists within my being I transmit through a mild erection;  ever since my holiday in Timor-Leste I've since mastered the rare art of  fear-to-arousal transference.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">My &quot;matan dook&quot; (that's &quot;witch doctor&quot;  for you non-enlightened filth) is a lovely Timorese man by the name of Carl; I  traded an entire consignment of Chesterfield's for the privilege of his  discipline - little does the bugger know that the only thing that's  Chesterfield about the fags are the packaging.&nbsp;  Carl's loss; my gain.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">&quot;Yallah!&quot;&nbsp;  Pierces my eardrums as I'm forced to my knees, the blindfold combatively  removed.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I'm looking at a half-dozen Berber mercenaries, witlessly  operating under the charge of one Berwick L.&nbsp;  Winthorpe, an AWOL British Commander-turned-warlord living under the nom  de guerre Nassor Lef&egrave;vre.&nbsp; I received an  anonymous tip that Winthorpe/Lef&egrave;vre was spotted in Cairo some three weeks  prior.&nbsp; The bounty on his head is worth  two million pounds and rising - and I aim to claim it.&nbsp; See, Winthorpe/Lef&egrave;vre is the very reason I'm  in this pickle -&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7"><em>&quot;I've got a clear  shot at your head, Winthorpe/Lef&egrave;vre.&quot;&nbsp;  I uttered nine hours prior.&nbsp;</em></p>
  <p align="left" class="style7"><em>The Walther's grip  felt warm even in my gloved palm; two of Winthorpe/Lef&egrave;vre's heavies laid  motionless on the wood behind me - the reason for my pistol's rise in temperature.</em></p>
  <p align="left" class="style7"><em>Winthorpe/Lef&egrave;vre sat  facing his window.&nbsp; His hair colored  jet-black, falling at his shoulders, palpably overwhelming his slender  frame.&nbsp; The man had abandoned a  considerable amount of weight - most do when converting to crime and living  life on the lamb.&nbsp; He was the picture of  stillness, barely moved his lips to say, &quot;Is that you, Roger?&quot;</em></p>
  <p align="left" class="style7"><em>&quot;Considering the  fact I'm about to make two million quid?&nbsp;  I surely hope so.&nbsp; Why don't you  put your hands on the table, after do you drop the Lugar.&quot;</em></p>
  <p align="left" class="style7"><em>The Parabellum clunked  the wood.&nbsp; Winthorpe/Lef&egrave;vre carefully  touched the desk with both palms, facing  down.&nbsp; He might've had his back to me,  but he was watching.&nbsp; Not all of us need  eyes to see.&nbsp; I edged toward him, scooped  the pistol.&nbsp; Then searched him.&nbsp; I found a two-inch Smith and a Bayonet on his  person.&nbsp; The bastard had a gun to his  head, and yet he bragged, &quot;I'm not an easy man to find.&quot;</em></p>
  <p align="left" class="style7"><em>&quot;Gaver from the  Yard said nabbing you was next to futile.&nbsp;  Claimed you were the most elusive man on the continent.&nbsp; I suppose that makes me the most  capable.&quot;</em></p>
  <p align="left" class="style7"><em>&quot;How much to let  me walk?&quot;</em></p>
  <p align="left" class="style7"><em>&quot;If that's a  joke, you're a dreadful comedian.&nbsp; Best  you stick to crime.&quot; </em></p>
  <p align="left" class="style7"><em>&quot;Five million  pounds.&nbsp; In your hands in under an  hour.&nbsp; All you have to do is accompany me  to the bank.&quot;</em></p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">And that's why I'm in the desert, not because I believed him  - because he kept me talking.&nbsp; I can't  even recall what was said after he made the offer - it didn't matter.&nbsp; I was the bloody fool for engaging him when I  should&rsquo;ve pulled the trigger.&nbsp; By the time  I realized how long our exchange dragged on his mercs had reported to the  hideout, rifles up.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I'm watching a short, chest-rattling burst from a  Kalashnikov hammer one of the prisoners to the sand.&nbsp; An eye-patched merc grips my face, trains it  on the corpse - just to be sure I'm not missing anything.&nbsp; Eye Patch shoves me into the dirt.&nbsp; The other prisoners avert their gaze.&nbsp; It's my turn to die.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">On my hands and knees, sandy-eyed, wiping desert from my  stubble.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m staring at the boots of my  executioner, and there they are: knots.&nbsp;  Two of them.&nbsp; Tighter than a  sister's fanny.&nbsp; And then comes the rage,  stacking up, working my heart like a punching bag.&nbsp; My executioner,&nbsp; no doubt the same dodger who secured my  blindfold before tossing me into the vehicle.&nbsp;  I stare at the barrel of his weapon, rising to fire, blocking out my  sun.&nbsp; Pull the trigger you bastard -</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Shouting.&nbsp;  Gunfire.&nbsp; The thunder of an  engine.&nbsp; It's bloody bedlam and I don't  know why.&nbsp; There's a gap in my memory  bank, between the moment I was staring down the barrel of that knot-tying  cretin's rifle and now is an irksome blur.&nbsp;  Damn you, Roger, you've gone and blacked out again.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I'm behind the wheel of the transport vehicle.&nbsp; Driving like a madman.&nbsp; There's blood on my hands, but I feel no pain.&nbsp; Eyes to my mirrors: prisoners in the cabin,  armed for bear and trading shots with mercs - packed like sardines in a '34  Packard.&nbsp; A hard left and we're in  downtown Cairo -&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">&quot;Out of the way, or die!&quot; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Traffic's a horror, but I make due - threading, exploiting  both lanes.&nbsp; A bullet punctures the  windshield from behind.&nbsp; These guns for  hire mean business - so I slam the brakes.&nbsp;  Prisoners hold tight, bear witness as the collision modifies the '34  Packard into a present day accordion.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">The mercs come to - well, some do.&nbsp; Winded and outfoxed, their mangled limbs  fused with crumbled steel and devastated glass.&nbsp;  Prisoners raise their rifles, let their former captors have it.&nbsp; A vengeful rendition of Rat-a-tat-tat echoes  through Cairo's corridors.&nbsp; I put Clark  to gas and tear off, leaving behind a smoldering hunk of dead man and  irreparable machine.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Showered, clean-shaven and freshly clothed.&nbsp; I'm standing at the edge of a lonely corner,  inhaling the tail end of a Dunhill and street-lit.&nbsp; Across the pavement -</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Snobs.&nbsp; Dozens of  them.&nbsp; Crowding a gimcrack eatery  masquerading as a four-star French cafe dubbed Arabesque.&nbsp; The touristy clientele attired in newly  acquired linens and silks, boasting about their 'perilous' desert tours and  expert haggling methods with local merchants.&nbsp;  These highbrows are wining and dining to their hearts' content,  oblivious to the shadow across the street, establishing a firm a grip on the  Walther tucked away in the left pocket of his tan trousers.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I give my Dunhill the flick, stride across the asphalt.&nbsp; A barreling taxi locks before me - don't  flinch, don't freeze - just keep it moving.&nbsp;  In the cafe now, shoving the ma&icirc;tre d' aside.&nbsp; Walther drawn.&nbsp; Safety off -</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">A fair girl in Levis and frayed Frye's whirls in her seat: a  man in a Panama sits across.&nbsp; He lifts  his head - it's Winthorpe/Lef&egrave;vre and he's pissing fear.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">BANG-BANG!&hellip;BANG!&nbsp;  Three times I shoot him.&nbsp; If he  isn't dead, he's well on his way.&nbsp; The  cowgirl screams.&nbsp; Patrons make way as I  march out the front doors, jump in that taxi and pass the driver enough to get  me to Port Said.&nbsp; By the time someone  dials the law, we're outside Cairo.&nbsp; Just  a cabbie and his fare taking in another ravishing Arabian night.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Looks as if I'm The Reaper for the present, and it's time  I'm bloody paid...</p>

  <p align="left" class="style19">MEMO TO: <strong>THORNHILL</strong>, R.O.<br />
    FROM: <strong>BASE-CHATHAM-RIDLEY</strong><br />
  <br />
    Roger. Roger. Stop. Look around. Where the hell are you?  I have been advised by Ms. Julian to pull an M on you and request your badge  and gun, as well as cut off your credit access until you report into  Home. <br />
  <br />
    If there is a conflict, relay thru Anouk before it is too late. <br />
  <br />
    Trouble always finds its way to land directly under the soles of your shoes. I  know you stomp hard and parade in new pairs across many continents, but really,  Roger, this distant void of insolent noise has to stop. Let me know when you  are ready to start proper.<br />
  <br />
    Rendezvous: &ldquo;Come clean. You need a shower.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style19">Until Then,<br />

    <div>
      <p align="left" class="style7">The mother's derri&egrave;re was oddly shaped, like a triangle  doing a handstand.&nbsp; She howls in a  dreadful tone of voice - a bloody earsore: </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">&quot;C&aacute;llate!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">Not even flanged earplugs could hush this racket.&nbsp; She repeats herself, more audible than  before:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">&quot;C&aacute;llate la boca!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">And yet her child protests.&nbsp;  A stern mother would have the right mind to deliver a proper strike  across the nose - that's how I was placed.&nbsp;  I turned out marvelously.&nbsp; Aside  from the rare act of justifiable larceny and the odd tussle with chaps more  than deserving of a good hiding, I'm a model citizen.&nbsp; Polished, read, benevolent.&nbsp; Perhaps I should open a school: The Thornhill  Academy for Proper Being.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">Better have Janice draft a memo: 'Tactics.&nbsp; Inquiries.&nbsp;  Priorities.&nbsp; The Thornhill Academy  For Proper Being.&nbsp; Pursue the appropriate  channels and hobnob accordingly.&nbsp;  Pronto.'</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">The ferry leaves Puntarenas; Poon-tah-re-nahs as the locals  love to enunciate.&nbsp; Too much rolling of  the tongue for my tastes.&nbsp; Shoot me, I  call it like I read it.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">&quot;For you se&ntilde;or.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">The chap with a tan slips me a piece of paper - aged  parchment, 3 x 3 1/4 inches.&nbsp; I glance  the message while the Tan torches two Padillas.&nbsp;  I mumble nothing worth mentioning and trade paper for Padilla.&nbsp; The Tan sets fire to the document, giving it a  good toss into the roiling drink.&nbsp; Ocean  waters.&nbsp; The damnedest thing.&nbsp; Never like you see in the postcards.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">The Padilla receives a long, healthy draw.&nbsp; I taste Miami as the ferry carries visitor  and Costa Rican alike to the jungled peninsula...</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">Fifty-four foggy minutes later and I'm holding a four-inch  Colt, grip burning palm like a hot cup of Turkish.&nbsp; The Tan bleeds beside me.&nbsp; His wound rests just above the clavicle -  still issuing smoke.&nbsp; I jam a small  branch between his teeth.&nbsp; The Tan bites  hard.&nbsp; His pain now on mute. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">We're sheltered behind a cristobal tree.&nbsp; I count five rebels closing the gap, thirty  meters and counting.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">Sixty seconds to act, maybe less.&nbsp; Roger, dear boy - think!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">What's certain are my 1300's.&nbsp; Snug and ideally cushioned.&nbsp; Uncompromised amidst the most taxing of  crouched positions.&nbsp; And then there's the  mesh toe-box, dispersing generous amounts of euphoria to the southern quarters  of my trotters. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">I release the Colt's cylinder: three rounds for five  rebels.&nbsp; Impossible to most, but I've  done more with much less.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">Eyes shut, five deep breaths and my fury is summoned.&nbsp; My power animal's an eleventh century Piker  by the name of Eric the Quarrelsom.&nbsp; Ten  feet between the rebels and yours truly.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">I step out from behind the cristobal, hands aimed at the  gathering clouds - Colt-less. The rebels freeze, bolt-actions up and trembling: they're  afraid of me and I can't say I blame them.&nbsp;  A moustached fellow with a lazy lower lip takes the lead.&nbsp; His stride stutters fearfully.&nbsp; Even if I spy a machete holstered to his hip,  my eyes betray nothing.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">Moustache motions to search me - his first and final  folly.&nbsp; Before he can speak - before his  mind can process the gesture, the revolver's in my hand.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">The Colt jumps once: moustache down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">The rebels open fire just in time to mow down their own  compadre.&nbsp; I stand behind moustache: when  in doubt use a shield.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">The Colt jumps again: rebel down.&nbsp; Three to go.&nbsp;  Let's even the score, shall we?</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">I pitch moustache's carcass toward the firing squad,  knocking down the three amigos like bowling pins.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">My Colt jumps a third time: rebel down.&nbsp; Two to go.&nbsp;  No mas bolas.&nbsp; So I hack.&nbsp; I'm a butcher on Sunday.&nbsp; Cleaving my opposers to mincemeat.&nbsp; Thunder claps.&nbsp; Rain sweeps over the jungle, washing away the  gore.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">I cry to the heavens, releasing the fury within.&nbsp; Hands to knees and gasping for air - I'm  Roger again. </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">I hoist the Tan over my shoulder and begin the long trudge  back to the docks.&nbsp; The warlord is  dead.&nbsp; Costa Rica will sleep soundly this  evening.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">Back on the damned ferry and craving a shower.&nbsp; Somewhere in an unnamed village the Tan rests  in a hospital bed, bullet out, speeding towards a healthy recovery.&nbsp; The peninsula slowly shrinks as we gain  distance.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">I'm four pages into a spy novel before I toss it  overboard.&nbsp; Who reads this rubbish?</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">And then she sits beside me.&nbsp;  Skin silky-smooth, hair jet black with subtle streaks of blonde  interwoven.&nbsp; I don't know her name or  from where she hails, but something about this one spells t-r-o-u-b-l-e.&nbsp; I feel a nudge me from beneath her elbow,  recognizing that old feeling.&nbsp; Time to  break the ice, &quot;Your gun is poking at my heart.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">She remains still.&nbsp;  Her tone is even - she's done this before.&nbsp; The accent places her somewhere in the Mediterranean,  Gibraltar if I had to guess.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">&quot;Stand up, Mr. Thornhill, and remain casual.&nbsp; When we reach the port, I will lead you to a  white sedan.&nbsp; If you attempt to defy my  instructions the Walther will fire.&nbsp;  Please nod if you understand me.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">I look into her eyes, arrested.&nbsp; Never before has beauty presented itself so  stunningly.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">And just as instructed I nod my head.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style7">I understand, indeed.</p>
    </div>

  <br />
  <p><img src="images/Vans-Vault-Zapato-Chukka-Del-Barco-LX-31.jpg" width="440" height="360" /></p>
  <p class="style5">Zapato Del Barco</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">It's the damned ringing in my ears.&nbsp; Constant.&nbsp;  Endless.&nbsp; Nagging.&nbsp; My head's the real problem: it's throbbing.&nbsp; Like the agonizing aftermath of a headlong  collision with a brick wall - whatever that feels like.&nbsp; I haven't seen this many colors since my days  in the Legion when that scheming bastard Jackson slipped lysergide in my  Gibson.&nbsp; I still owe him a slug, or  two.&nbsp; If I make it out of this chamber  alive, I'll have my secretary add it to the agenda: 'Find that pest of a  specimen Jackson and smite him for befouling my Gibson, period dot.'</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">While we're on the subject of smiting, my interrogator  issues a right fist - his fourth.&nbsp; I hear  my nose break - then I feel it.&nbsp; My  nostrils are whistling - that means I'm still breathing.&nbsp; Don't count me out just yet.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I'm staring at a duo of hoodlums.&nbsp; One tall, pure brawn; the other wiry,  jockey-short.&nbsp; Their unremarkable apparel  places them at low-level on the underworld scale.&nbsp; Did I mention pea-brained?&nbsp; If the Syndicate thinks I'm going to give the  location of those precious coins to a couple of their nickel-and-dime bruisers,  well by God they've never tangled with Roger O. Thornhill.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Behind me: the fibrous restraints binding my wrists are  beginning to give - thank heavens I shaved with a razor blade this morning.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">The jockey lands a fist just above my right cheekbone.&nbsp; I feel two knuckles dig into my eye.&nbsp; More colors.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">The brawn paces behind him, cracking his knuckles - all  threat and posture.&nbsp; His German lilt is  heavy, impatient, &quot;Where are the coins, Mr. Thornhill.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Addressing me as &quot;Mr.&quot;, it's comforting to know he  realizes his place in the world.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I don't even look at the brawn, spitting blood on the  jockey's downmarket loafers instead.&nbsp; I begin to laugh, my nose performing a flute solo, &quot;My  chin, aim for the chin, young man.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">The Jockey swings, oblivious to the fact that I've cut  myself free.&nbsp; I bring my arm around - the  razorblade wedged between my middle and index fingers - countering the jockey's  strike.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">The brawn blinks, missing that split-second interval where  I've opened the jockey's windpipe.&nbsp; All  he sees now is his vertically challenged comrade whimpering on the floor,  choking on his own crimson.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Now let me be clear: I'm no killer.&nbsp; I find the sport to be heartless,  mean-spirited.&nbsp; But when a man of my experience and conditioning is forced  into a corner, my instincts take the stage - anything goes, really.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">The brawn draws his Luger.&nbsp;  I hurl the chair I was tied to, deflecting the shots.&nbsp; Wood explodes into a thousand splinters,  mid-flight.&nbsp; I catch a leg from the chair  before it meets the floor, club the brawn with it - a symphony of thwacks and  thumps.&nbsp; As of now, the brawn was.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">The door to the chamber flies open: a third hoodlum spots me  sprinting for the window.&nbsp; His Thompson  spits a long chain of fire as I dive through glass, freefalling into the  Rhine.&nbsp; I swim to an imperceptible  depth.&nbsp; Thompson rounds slicing through  the drink, zipping past me like burning bot flies.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Four hundred meters to the embankment.&nbsp; I'm front-crawling in S-pull patterns - rapid  acceleration, abbreviating the distance.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">A German.&nbsp; Chap by the  name of Biedermann is reputed for holding the record in the Men's Four Hundred  Meter Long Course at three minutes, seven seconds and seven-tenths of a  second.&nbsp; I reach the embankment in three  flat.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Sorry, Biedermann.&nbsp;  Keep swimming.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I surface, climbing onto dry land - I'm a wet towel dripping  salt water.&nbsp; My Zapato Del Barcos  squish/squash excess H20 with every step.&nbsp;  The leather panels remain intact.&nbsp;  A man who neglects to waterproof his shoes is unfit to serve.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I vault a set of stairs, spilling onto the busy streets of  Cologne, though my current odor denigrates the spirit of the city that enhanced  man's fragrance.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">A shower, Roger.&nbsp;  Now.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I hail a cab, tell the driver, &quot;Grandhotel Schloss  Bensberg, and hurry.&quot;&nbsp; My Deutsch is  flawless.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I produce my flask, draw three swigs of Michters -  champion's rye.&nbsp; My blood drops ten  degrees, back where I belong.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I'm at the doors of the hotel in under four minutes.&nbsp; The driver receives a damp, albeit generous  tip.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">In my suite, shedding my shirt, trousers.&nbsp; I look in the mirror, set my nose.&nbsp; The pain triggers a grunt.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Nastassja lies naked on the bed, a Vogue magazine before  her.&nbsp; She asks how I got the bruises.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I turn for the bathroom, hurried, &quot;None of your damned  business.&nbsp; Mix us a Gibson.&quot;&nbsp; She stretches her legs - smooth, strong, edible.&nbsp; Moves for the bar, prepares our drinks.&nbsp; Her English needs practice, but it's music to  my ears, &quot;Come to bed, Roger.&quot;<br />
    &nbsp; <br />
  Below the sink, I find my leather shave kit.&nbsp; I unzip it, ensuring the 500-hundred year-old  Ottoman Empire coins still remain - they do.&nbsp;  Relief.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Nastassja calls out again, anxious, &quot;Come to bed,  Roger!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I draw hot water, peeling off the shoes, &quot;In a moment,  dear.&nbsp; But first a shower.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Nastassja is at the door, holding our Gibsons like a good  girl, &quot;How about a bath?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I take my glass, sample the martini.&nbsp; Perfect.&nbsp;  Just like I taught her.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I look her up and down.&nbsp;  My blood's up five degrees.&nbsp; I  crack a smile.&nbsp; My eyebrow arches.&nbsp; Shoot me.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">I look into her eyes, starving, &quot;Yes.&nbsp; How about a bath?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Roger, you dog.</p>

  <p class="style5">The Air Max 90 </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">Hooligans.&nbsp; Filthy.&nbsp; Vicious.&nbsp; Out for blood.&nbsp; They're chasing me.&nbsp; Over a debt?&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman?&nbsp; This doesn't concern me.&nbsp; The point is I'm running for my life and I'm late for drinks with Cal.<br />
    <br />
  The sky's an oven.&nbsp; The air smells of pure gasoline - I'm perspiring.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  And these damned trainers on my feet.&nbsp; They're gripping asphalt like the claws of a mad dog.&nbsp; My soles are practically on fire.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  The Air Max 90, I believe they're called. The Air Max III before the year 2K. One part mesh, one part nubuck.&nbsp; It was love at first sight.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  I'm mad dashing over tin rooftops.&nbsp; Homes - people live here.&nbsp; Must be something, living on top of one another - Favela.&nbsp; What a sight.&nbsp; A district in the likeness of a staircase.&nbsp; And I'm racing down, cat leaping roof-to-roof.&nbsp; My heels are drilling the air capsules with every pressured drop.&nbsp; And yet they gain.<br />
  <br />
  I think I hear the crack of a rusted Colt.&nbsp; I don't stop to check - I'm almost to the asphalt of Downtown Rio.&nbsp; Three minutes &lsquo;til drinks.<br />
  <br />
  Go for broke, Roger.&nbsp; You can do this.<br />
  <br />
  I'm creating a sizeable gap between me and my pursuers.&nbsp; Have I always been this fast?&nbsp; Or are these shoes a gift from God?<br />
  <br />
  A roundabout, paces ahead.&nbsp; Bumper to bloody bumper.<br />
  <br />
  I jump the hood of a moving Renault, skip to the windshield of a careening 5-Series.&nbsp; An improvised 180 takes me to the center fountain.&nbsp; I'm a spider monkey.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  And the hooligans are declining in number, bodies tumbling beneath a chain of grinding wheels.&nbsp; If they're dead it's their own damn fault.<br />
  <br />
  Launching into a zig-zag pattern, steady stops and pivots.&nbsp; A maze of swerving vehicles - I should be dead.&nbsp; But somehow I've found the sidewalk and I'm pushing through children, merchants, tourists.&nbsp; Out of my way.<br />
  <br />
  There's Cal, waving at me from a chair outside the cafe - thank heavens he got us a table.<br />
  <br />
  A final glance behind me: no sign of the hooligans.&nbsp; Better trade seats with Cal, just to be sure - his vantage point will keep me on alert.&nbsp; Eyes down -</p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">My trainers are spotless.&nbsp; Not a scratch.&nbsp; Money well spent&hellip;</p>

  <p class="style5">The Air Jordan XI </p>
  <p align="left" class="style7">To be certain of shoe's merits, apply to the ground with either a rough and ridged, soft and fast, long and heavy, loose and joyous or tight and flying glide to your pace. XI should walk like a brushstroke on any medium. No paint required. Designed by Tinker Hatfield, the shoe is  masterpiece theatre for the concrete jungle. </p>
