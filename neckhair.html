  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>In the basement of the old Hotel Sylvania  building there's a barbershop.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been there for 89 years, but  Salvatore hasn't been there that long, he chuckles as he tells me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal's  been there for 26 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since before the building was converted  into condos that go for six figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the porn theaters left  in favor of BYOB restaurants, upscale house-wares and all-natural artisan  soaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the neighborhood caught the name Midtown Village.</em> <br />
    <br />
      <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's  a barbershop; there are three chairs, one is Sal's, the other is Joe's, the  owner, next to each other on the west wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe bought the place  recently and looks younger than Sal, but the close-cropped hair he has left is  gray and contrasts with his thick, black-rimmed glasses.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the  north wall, facing the street, is another chair, a sink in front of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;A  white towel with a thin blue stripe down the middle hangs off the sink, half in  and half out of the basin.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the right of the sink is a shelf with  a mirrored cabinet door.&nbsp;&nbsp;This sink and chair are not used.&nbsp;&nbsp;All  that's in the shelf with the mirrored cabinet door and under it the small nook  to put your tools and under two drawers, side by side, is a dusty sign that  looks like it hung on the wall when every man coming in here still wore a  hat.&nbsp;</em> </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A  gentleman needs a good haircut, everyone knows that.&nbsp;&nbsp;But who knows  what a good haircut is?&nbsp;Does it cost a princely sum?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or do you  perform it yourself? Getting a haircut should be a relaxing,  restorative experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you prefer, and have the means, to go to  a luxury spa for manicure, pedicure, facial, massage, the works, then by all  means, do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a man without the means or inclination for luxury  should feel no less pampered by the simple pleasure of devoting time to look  your best.&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper grooming is essential for a man interested in  being a gentleman.&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should  you choose to go the professional route and have someone other than yourself  cut your hair, great care should be taken in selecting a barber.&nbsp;&nbsp;First  you must consider the price.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most men get their haircut every month  to month and a half.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must find an establishment that fits your  wallet.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing you should fret about is how you will pay for  a good haircut.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you find a place whose price is reasonable,  make sure that it fits with your personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I mean by  this?&nbsp;&nbsp;If their website, and they should have a website for crying  out loud it&rsquo;s twenty goddamn ten!, proclaims that they seek to reach new  heights of art with every scissor stroke and lists a clientele of prominent  politicos and business elite, think to yourself if this is really the company  you would like to keep.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re striving for that corner office or  seat on city council, then this may be the perfect place for you to do a little  casual networking.&nbsp;But in the end you&rsquo;ll have to go there and get a cut to  really get a feel for the place.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some  months ago I was in search of a barber.&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend who had loyally cut  my hair for years was moving outside of the city and it would be much less  convenient for her to cut my hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a man who likes  convenience, I started looking around for alternatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered  a fancy salon in a very expensive neighborhood where some years ago I had  received, free of charge, one of the best haircuts of my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is  a salon with a modern, industrial d&eacute;cor and a large ego.&nbsp;&nbsp;I made an  appointment, not worrying about the sixty-five dollar price, because I  considered it a present to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;My first &ldquo;real&rdquo; haircut in  years.&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat in the chair after having my hair shampooed and rinsed  and was horrified.&nbsp;&nbsp;My stylist had a terrible case of butterfingers  and kept dropping his scissors, which necessitated a dunk in barbicide each  time.&nbsp;&nbsp;His comb broke.&nbsp;&nbsp;His tattooed, clammy hands reeked  of stale cigarettes and the cut I received didn&rsquo;t even come close to the one I  received years earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;I paid, left a standard gratuity, and left,  feeling good about having less hair, but certain I would never return.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About  two months passed and I was desperately in need of another cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;I  began searching reviews online and found a place that seemed right up my  alley.&nbsp;&nbsp;The descriptions people gave of their experiences were  glowing, and they played jazz in the barbershop!&nbsp;&nbsp;I called up to see  if I could get an appointment that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;A man with an Italian accent  answered the phone and told me, &ldquo;just come by at six, we&rsquo;ll fit you in.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  arrived and stepped down into the basement to a scene from another time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leather  barber chairs, bright tile gleaming white and sure enough, jazz piping through  the speakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The icing on the cake, though, was the straight razor  the barber used on the back of my neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;This implement is what  separates the good from the great.&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a normal haircut from  something merely functional; the shortening and removal of unwanted lengths of  head hair, to the luxurious, the manly.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is part of the  craft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone can run a buzzer over the back of your neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;But  how many can wield a straight razor with such precision?&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you  I&rsquo;ve never felt more like a gentleman than after Sal wiped the shaving cream  off the back of my neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave Sal 20 dollars for the cut and a  five for a tip and I can safely say that that cut was more than 3 times as good  as the previous cut I&rsquo;d paid around 70 dollars for.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had found my  barbershop.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now  my neck was smooth, rubbing the back of it was wonderful and I never wanted  that feeling to go away.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I knew it would.&nbsp;&nbsp;What does  one do when the inevitable neck hair begins to return? Most men live with some  degree of neck hair and I am no exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair on the back of  my neck is thinner and lighter in color than that of my head and face.&nbsp;&nbsp;It  is wispy, golden and somewhat of a nuisance but generally tolerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;There  is almost no better sensation than feeling my neck after a haircut, smooth and  hairless, a bare stubble pulling back against the palm of my hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;But  after this moment of a hairless back-neck, each day brings me closer to a point  where that soft hair has formed two curly puffs below my hairline and above my  shirt collar.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look in the mirror and I can see the brambles poking  around the side of my neck.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A  gentleman should use a beard trimmer or some similar implement to keep his neck  hair in check.&nbsp;&nbsp;A swift up, down, back and forth is all he needs to  tame an unsightly and ungentlemanly crop of neck hair without resorting to too  frequent trips to the barber.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a gentleman is not only about  looking your best, or as close to your best as you can reasonably muster, but  also about living within your means and even achieving some degree of  frugality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if a gentleman has the means to see a barber every  week or every other week, should he?&nbsp;&nbsp;No.&nbsp;That 20 or 30  dollars (or more if they&rsquo;ve really got you by the asshole) could be much better  spent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the time to do certain things for yourself, like  trimming your neck hair, will put more money in your pocket and let you feel  better about buying a young lady an expensive cocktail or two, or splurging on  some high quality ingredients for a fabulous dinner with close  friends.&nbsp;When a fellow gentleman asks at a small gathering you are hosting  for no reason in particular, &ldquo;How much do I owe you for the beer?&rdquo; you can look  at him assuredly and say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I trim my&nbsp;<em>own </em>neck hair.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For  men with shoulder length or longer hair, the presence of neck hair is generally  not a concern because the ungentlemanly length of their hair obscures it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why  is long hair ungentlemanly, you may ask?&nbsp;&nbsp;For many, many reasons but  let me describe the most pertinent.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as any gentleman who has  ever shared a bathroom with a long-haired lady will tell you, long hair is  disgusting.&nbsp;&nbsp;After even one shower, he will find the tub drain cover  caked with soapy, clumpy hair and, if she has not taken the lady-like step of  removing her head-sheddings, he will be forced to lest the gentleman wish to  stand in a ankle-deep pool of his own filth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, are you really  going to put a lady&rsquo;s hair elastic in your hair, thereby creating a  ponytail?&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha!&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I can imagine it  now: &ldquo;Darling, I&rsquo;m trying to iron my shirt for dinner this evening but my long,  lady-like hair keeps getting in the way of my face and I&rsquo;m afraid it will get  singed on the iron.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you fetch me one of those elastics you use  to put your hair back when you&rsquo;re performing fellatio on me?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  list could go on and on but suffice to say a gentleman should have a neat,  reasonable crop of hair that doesn&rsquo;t require him to use an implement commonly  employed in cock-sucking.</p>
