&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They covered the soles of their hiking boots with cloth to disguise their tracks and carried a small arsenal of weapons.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough terrain and windy conditions contributed to the length of time it took to find the couple, said the man who headed the search, Colonel Tip Brink.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end it was thermal imaging equipment fitted to a helicopter and a tip-off from a resident which led police to their hide-out---a building just 500m from the farm house where they had lived rent free for a decade, and prepared for the end of the world.</p>

Even though he couldn't talk yet, he would gurgle, and he would gurgle in perfect pitch. No matter where my husband went on the notes or scales, he would be in perfect pitch harmony. He was born with that.</p>

<p align="center" class="style2">INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO CRY</p>
<p align="center" class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" class="style10">Putting the reasons for crying aside for the moment, we might concentrate on the correct way to cry, which, be it understood, means a weeping that doesn't turn into a big commotion nor proves an affront to the smile with its parallel and dull similarity. The average, everyday weeping consists of a general contraction of the face and a spasmodic sound accompanied by tears and mucus, this last toward the end, since the cry ends at the point when one energetically blows one's nose.</p>
<p align="left" class="style10">In order to cry, steer the imagination toward yourself, and if this proves impossible owing to having contracted the habit of believing in the exterior world, think of a duck covered with ants or of those gulfs in the Straits of Magellan<em> into which no one sails ever</em>.</p>
<p align="left" class="style10">Coming to the weeping itself, cover the face decorously, using both hands, palms inward. Children are to cry with the sleeve of the dress or shirt pressed against the face, preferably in a corner of the room. Average duration of the cry, three minutes.</p>

  <br />
  <strong>KELLY:</strong> You just know. That&rsquo;s about spirit. It&rsquo;s all about spirit  and having a connection with people. I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do the songs as long  as I&rsquo;ve been doing if I didn&rsquo;t feel the pulse of the world. But I can feel  people and I know what they want. I feel like I know how they are, because I&nbsp;<em>am</em><em>&nbsp;</em>the people. And I just have a  gift. I&rsquo;m like a pastor that can go anywhere and preach&mdash;Earth is my turf. And  the people have got to relate to him because where he goes, he always feel like  he&rsquo;s talking to that one person in the audience, but he&rsquo;s really talking to  everybody. And me, I&rsquo;m the same way with my music. It&rsquo;s not the same as going  to church, but it preaches.</p>

So far they don't scream for that little white boy no more.<br />
It's me and my team now. <br />
  Microphone fiend style.<br />
Lockin' the scene down.<br />
Like it's the P now.<br />
We seem wild, unruly and such.<br />
Just like Larry Davis and the tooly he clutch.<br />
More cool than a dead corpse.<br />
With more power than a thoroughbred horse.<br />
We bust the lead off.<br /> 
And spit riddles that could puzzle the nimble.<br />
Then trouble the fickle while it doubles my nickels.<br />
And gets a soochie-coochie emcee brains...<br />
Lalala.<br />
...Cars and like ten free chains.<br />
All I do is employ my telekinesis.<br />
I could find a nine and sell it to Jesus.<br />
Cause if I keep it, it's two in the tool bin.<br />
I don't get shot, I'm doin' the shootin'.</p>
