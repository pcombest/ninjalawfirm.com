  <p align="center" class="style6">COIN JAR </p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first coins are said to have been minted in Anatolia in what is now Turkey sometime in the second half of the fifth century, B.C.E. and were made of electrum, a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver.&nbsp; Today, coins are worth less than the copper they&rsquo;re minted on and are quite common, so common that at the end of a day of strolling about the city, tasting bakery treats or leafing through general interest magazines, a gentleman will often find himself with a pocketful of these disgusting, foul-smelling, pant-weights.&nbsp; What anyone who has ever been in this situation knows is that coins make a great deal of noise when confined to a moving pocket, especially when accompanied by a cell phone, pen or other plastic or metal implement of necessity.<br />
    <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing less gentlemanly than creating an undue amount of noise.&nbsp; In doing so, a man announces his presence prematurely and is unable to brush off the inevitable panhandler because his pocket noise belies his earnest insistence, &ldquo;Sorry, no change.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jingling is for bells at Christmastime. This is why a man should always keep a coin jar on his dresser or bureau.&nbsp; Upon returning home after a day, or night, out the gentleman empties his pockets of any change and deposits it in the coin jar.&nbsp; Over the course of days, weeks, months you will find your jar getting heavier, heavy with anticipation, for one of the great joys of keeping a coin jar is taking it to the bank when it is full and receiving fresh dollar bills in whatever denomination you desire.&nbsp; That shirt you had your eye on?&nbsp; Why, you just got $54.37 from that lovely bank teller.&nbsp; She would want you to have it, really she would.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the gentleman is away from home for more than a day, say on a romantic sojourn or a business call, he should deposit his pocket-change in the nearest caf&eacute; tip jar.&nbsp; Not only will he be relieving himself of unsoundly coinage, he will brighten a young barista&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; If this barista happens to be a young artist in her mid to late twenties looking for a figure drawing model and she notices your strong, sinewy hand as you let the coins fall and asks you to model for a drawing party held weekly at the house of one of her other bright, charming artist friends, then all the better.</p>
