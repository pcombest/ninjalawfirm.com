  <p align="left" class="style2">If it were at all possible I would dedicate this book to Jesus Christ the Redeemer, but instead He has dedicated it to me. I in turn, dedicate this book to you: my family, my friends, my fans. In my ten plus years of being in the &quot;industry,&quot; I have yet to accomplish anything that has fulfilled me more than being able to disclose my life to you. Not a video, not an award, not a tour, and definitely not a check could replace the satisfaction that I've received being able to share these truths with those who've supported me. It is my hope that <em>Wretched, Pitiful, Poor, Blind and Naked</em> brings guidance, purpose, wisdom, and meaning to your lives. So hopefully when you one day find yourself in the &quot;wildnerness,&quot; and you will, you will be able to take the short cut out.</p>

<p align="left" class="style25">CLOUDY DAYBREAK. Sitting in an armchair, with a cup of coffee in my hand, before having showered, I imagine the protagonist in the following way: his eyes closed, his face very pale, his hair dirty. He's lying on a train track. No. Only his head is over one of the rails, the rest of his body stretched out to the side of the track, on top of the whitish gray stones. It's strange: the left side of his body gives the impression of sleep's relaxation, but the other half seems rigid, stiff, as if he were already dead. In the upper part of the frame I can see a hillside of firs (yes, firs!) and on top of the hill a group of pink clouds, as if from a Golden Age dusk.<br />
  CLOUDY DAYBREAK. A man, poorly dressed and scruffy, asks me what I'm doing. I answer him, nothing. He replies that he's thinking of starting a bar. A place, he says, where people will go to eat. Pizzas. Not very expensive. Great, I say. Later someone asks if he's in love. What do you mean by that, he says. They explain: do you seriously like some woman. He replies that he does. It'll be a great bar, I say. He tells me I'm invited to the opening. You can eat whatever you want for free. </p>

<p align="center" class="style2">Battersea Power Station. South London. </p>
<p align="left" class="style2">Some of the most famous rap/Hype Williams videos were filmed here. Busta's <em>Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See. </em>Nas's<em> Hate Me Now. </em>Missy's <em>The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)</em>. We interviewed Hype about shooting on location in Battersea.</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">NLF</span>: Who's your favorite rapper?</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">HW</span>: Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">NLF</span>: Did you have to get a permit to film in Battersea?</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">HW</span>: No.</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">NLF</span>: What did Battersea mean to the rap community?</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">HW</span>: You know, it was this coming out for black people. We came out...covered in soot. The press thought we were filming black-on-black face. We weren't sure if we'd finish filming from all the backlash. Then we had Nas and Puff crucified <strong>on top of that. </strong></p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">NLF</span>: Puff didn't like that?</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">HW</span>: No Puff didn't. I asked him before he got on the cross if he was cool and he said yeah. But after the first edit he said no way. Whatever, we cut his part on the cross. It was Nas's song anyways.</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">NLF</span>: Were the working conditions dangerous inside?</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">HW</span>: Hell nah! We had top of the line generators pumping electricity. Kind of funny since we were in a coal power station. </p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">NLF</span>: So why all the soot?</p>
<p align="left" class="style2"><span class="style1">HW</span>: I like to keep it authentic. I didn't want to change too much. I was really into Von Trier and <em>Gummo</em> at the time. I wanted to bring a Dogma 95 aesthetic.</p>

  Cold, I know. <br />
  What's colder is these streets when your name no longer hot. You feel me?<br />
  Seen niggas and bitchs go through it. Dope game and the music.<br />
  Lifestyle hard to obtain, but it's easy to get used to it.<br />
  Try to maintain, under pressure, only few do it. <br />
  And that's what inspires you to try. <br />
  The gleam in your eye, manifested in your mind. Then you start your cryin, rememberin whoever you step on to come up, you may meet them another time. Fuck em though. <br />
  If the foot was on the other shoe them niggas would stand on you to get a better view. <br />
  Tellin you the truth while taking them to school. <br />
  Fools don't think how I think, can't see these lines like I scribbled in invisible ink in these tablets. <br />
  Jet Life Commandments. <br />
  Thou shalt not rest untill I make my whole fam rich. <br />
  Fuck you take me for?<br />

  Never that, JLR, we'll have this whole world changed by tomorrow.<br />
  Lighters and Ozium in my cars. And no way I'm I playin with ya'll.<br />
  When I say, I'm so high, if I was to trip and fall I'd land on Mars.<br />
  But don't mistake my highness for blindness.<br />
  Giving me them fake smiles, I know what's behind them.<br />
  I swim with the sharks everyday. You backstrokin with the guppies.<br />
  Supposedly big dogs get chopped down to puppie size. <br />
  Utterly euthanized by these flows I've been craftin. <br />
  Secretly  in my labyrinth, sleepin on a charred mattress. <br />
  Nights so hot, get that girl to the pool before she pass out.<br />
  Livin in a limo. 
  New Ferari underneath the carport, my landshark.<br />
  Invite me to your party, reserve me somewhere to park.<br />
  I'm not sure what you thought, fuck pullin off onto my lot.<br />
  Got 20 minutes free? How about a fast brunch?<br />
  Pitch me whatever proposals you want.<br />
  No promises though, I got a lot on my plate.<br />
  No ham omelets, I'm on my conglomerate.<br />

<p align="left">Anyways, yeah, MTV has once again conspired with the United States government to churn out more propaganda that encourages our youths to become walking, talking American Eagle Outfitter ads. Small Town Americana used to be about family values, hard work and racism. And thank the Lord, it's still about that, except now it must have a homogenized look to go with it. But, hell, as long as MTV encourages impressionable, horny tenders to get out on the dance floor and bust out their best wannabe approximations of strip club maneuvers, then well, we can't be all mad at Milquetoast Television, now can we? Because just the thought of getting your middle aged hands on barely legal ass is now, according to the latest amendment to the Constitution, the official new American Dream. And that goes for men and women. (We see you cougars.)</p>
<p align="left"><em>Footloose</em> stars some douche and Miley Cyrus. Except they couldn't actually get Billy Ray's wild seed, so they got Mandy Moore instead. Or, rather, some chick that might as well be Miley or Mandy. But in the end, let's be honest, it doesn't matter who they cast because as we all know very well any hot, young cocktease in a jean miniskirt giving half-assed lapdances is gonna be enough to attract millions of the nation's attention whore copycats addicted to tumblr and their bi-curious boyfriends to the theaters in droves. MTV knows their shit, those clever motherfuckers.</p>
<p align="left">The basic plot of <em>Footloose</em> should be well known to all by now. When a teenaged tragedy involving dancing happens in Hicksville, USA the village parents do the responsible thing: they blame Black people. Okay, they don't really, but banning hip-hop steps in 2011 is sorta the same thing as restricting &quot;race music&quot; in the '50s, no? Well, whatever the case, it ain't right making dancing illegal, especially since white folks still need all the help they can get. (To be fair, there are some &quot;colored&quot; extras dancing they asses off in the background, and there's a possibly-mixed hottie in a supporting role. Damn, that girl hot. She look like a twentysomething Maya Rudolph crossed with Laura Ingalls. This movie is suddenly getting better the more we think about it.) The grown folks' overreactions, of course, leads to an inevitable dance rebellion, with lots of scenes looking like the music videos they don't show on MTV no more. Oh, the irony.</p>
