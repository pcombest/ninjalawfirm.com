He was even reasoning to his boys in the studio that he should patent that shit before someone else copped it. Lo and behold. </p>

You wear both so well, they exclaimed as they tried to convince him to speak inside the New Found Church to the New Found Children. Sam Sam figured he would need a newfound suit or at least a black blazer. He cruised around to the thrift stores while he listened to <em>Frontin' On Christ</em> by Finesse. He thought to himself, I'll do a shampoo commercial if all else fails. I got that good hair. </p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">This guy from Buenos Aires, who calls himself a DJ and has MJ hair, took me out for ceviche last night before he performed a set at Shylar&rsquo;s House of Spit. He asked me my name, where I was from and if I wanted another drink. It felt like one of those (non)reality date shows. At one point, he even threw a shrimp down my blouse, which is usually a no-no, but I gave him a pass due to his fine features. Looks aside, if the shrimp had some sauce or ketchup on it I would have been furious.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">When we were young, Wal-Mart wouldn&rsquo;t sell our CD. On our album we talked about fucking young guys and dogs and schoolmates and melted ice cream&hellip;on the real, a whale and a chimp and sometimes dinosaurs. There was just a lot of different shit that came to mind, thus giving our album, <em>Fuck Buddies</em>, an explicit content warning. <br />
    Now that we are older, we don&rsquo;t really rap about fucking random things you wouldn&rsquo;t normally fuck, but Wal-Mart started carrying <em>Fuck Buddies</em> because it sold over 80 million units. They simply silenced all of the bad words. <br />
    We really fucking hate Wal-Mart and have since started shitting and pissing and vomiting in every Wal-Mart we come across, and not in the bathrooms, usually just in the middle of some aisle with food or even in the electronic section.&nbsp;</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">Tom and Jeff went quail hunting every Saturday during the in-season. They sat behind a blind and froze. Tom had 14 stuffed quails in his den and Jeff used quail beaks to make necklaces that he sold at a flea market in South Carolina. Jeff&rsquo;s trigger-finger got so cold one day that he couldn&rsquo;t pull the trigger on the upward fleeing quails. What would they think of him now at the flea market?</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">Jack sat in a pristine 50's-style diner off of I-95. He was somewhere down the road from Baltimore and he was  talking to Jeffrey, the waiter, about huffin. <br />
    Jack knew he was off schedule and needed to push on, but Jeffrey was holding him back. He was so damn silly, that Jeffrey. <br />
    He said, &quot;Hey Jack, the toast on your Reuben got burnt. Want some salty girts?&quot; <br />
    Jack blew coffee out of his nose. <br />
    Girts for Grits? This guy Jeffrey was a fucking riot, but the silence from the other six patrons made it obvious that Jack was the only one who felt this way. <br />
    While Jack wiped off his nose and the table, someone from the other side of the room yelled, &quot;Jeffrey! Where's those eggs and girts!?!?&quot; <br />
    Jeffrey replied, &quot;Mothafucka, you know! Don't make me get to huffin on you!&quot;<br />

    to the kitchen and found you on the floor.<br />
    We hugged. You asked what was happening<br />
    and I didn&rsquo;t tell you we were on death&rsquo;s program<br />
    but instead that we were going on a journey,<br />
    one more, together, and that you shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid. </p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">Out of nine lives Teddy had at least fourteen that I know of. Shep Gordon and I started managing Teddy in 1978, and through the almost thirty-two-years, we witnessed such tenacity from him. We saw someone who could suffer and keep his head up high; we learned that greatness is a gift, not a right; and we learned that we should appreciate everything we have now, because it can be lost in a moment. Often imitated - but I can say as a consistent witness, never duplicated - he rode Gamble and Huff songs like Ben-Hur in the Circus Maximus. He could give life to any song he sang. I say all this because being an artist was a very important role to Teddy, and he never faltered in it, he never phoned it in, and he gave everything he had, in life as in death.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">A next consideration in my five-point framework is climate change, a term that today we tend to associate with global warming caused by humans. In fact, climate may become hotter or colder, wetter or drier, or more or less variable between months or between years, because of changes in natural forces that drive climate and that have nothing to do with humans. Examples of such forces include changes in the heat put out by the sun, volcanic eruptions that inject dust into the atmosphere, changes in the orientation of the Earth's axis with respect to its orbit, and changes in the ditribution of land and ocean over the face of the Earth. Frequently discussed cases of natural climate change include the advance and retreat of continental ice sheets during the Ice Ages beginning over two million years ago, the so-called Little Ice Age from about A.D. 1400 to 1800, and the global cooling following the enormous volcanic eruption of Indonesia's Mt. Tambora on April 5, 1815. That eruption injected so much dust into the upper atmosphere that the amount of sunlight reaching the ground decreased until the dust settled out, causing widespread famines even in North America and Europe due to cold temperatures and reduced crop yields in the summer of 1816 (&quot;the year without a summer&quot;). </p>
