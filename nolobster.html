  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we blame John F. Kennedy?&nbsp; The first commander-in-chief to go hatless, he and his wife were fashion icons of their day.&nbsp; Maybe it was just too windy on the Cape and the Kennedys had had their hats blown into Nantucket Sound too many times so that finally one day Joe Sr. gathered the clan on the back patio and said &ldquo;Boys, from this day fahwahd, the Kennedy fam&rsquo;ly will no longah weah hats.&rdquo; And like proud Naval Academy grads they tossed their panamas skyward, cheering as they watched them flitter and tumble off into some tall grass.&nbsp; Adventurous young summer explorers still find expensive hats caked in mud and sand near the Kennedy compound.&nbsp; Nevertheless, as President Kennedy was sending our brave astronauts into the uncharted depths of space he was also, perhaps unintentionally, sending hats into the black hole of outmoded fashion. </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today a gentleman needs to take only a swift glance at the sidewalks of his city to see that the hat has returned to some degree of popularity.&nbsp; Sure, there have been men that wore hats throughout these past 50 years, but they were generally part of an older demographic.&nbsp; By and large, you would never have seen a young man of twenty-something don a fedora in the &ldquo;whatever, my jeans have holes in them and so does my flannel&rdquo; days of the 1990&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Only in the last few years, it seems, has the hat become a staple of warm-weather fashion.&nbsp; While preparing for a long weekend to the beach on Massachusetts&rsquo; South Shore, I thought it would be a good idea to look for a hat that would protect my skin from the sun as well as look good.&nbsp; I knew that a baseball cap was out; not enough back-of-the-neck protection.&nbsp; With a mental image clear in my brain I went hunting and, sure enough, found a near-perfect Stetson panama.&nbsp; A few weeks after my trip I was reading the New York Times when I ran across a short article about the surging popularity of straw hats on the streets of New York City, many sold from street vendors for reasonable prices.&nbsp; I thought, &ldquo;The hat is back.&rdquo; </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little over a year later and the trend has not died down.&nbsp; Indeed, I still see those sidewalk vendors hawking hats and young men and women wearing them in greater numbers than a year ago.&nbsp; For gentleman considering purchasing their first fedora I say, emphatically, do it!, but first, take heed of these recommendations: </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important things to consider when purchasing a hat are fit, look and material.&nbsp; First, I will address fit.&nbsp; A hat should fit snugly but not bind.&nbsp; The distance between the tip of your nose and the brim of the hat should be roughly equal to the distance between the brim and the top of the hat&rsquo;s crown.&nbsp; This is not a hard and fast rule and those with especially bulbous or cone-shaped heads should consult a headshrinker.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of a hat is to be worn and the point of wearing a hat, besides looking stylish, smart and sophisticated, is to keep the life-giving radiation of earth&rsquo;s sun off the top of your head, face and neck. &nbsp;There are few things less gentlemanly than having a bright, red sunburn covering your entire head and neck.&nbsp; Do you want to look like a boiled lobster?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; Time and time again I see men who lacked the foresight to protect themselves from pain and embarrassment caused by unprotected sun exposure.&nbsp; Many people take great pains to slather sunscreen liberally over their exposed extremities without ever stopping to consider that patch of skin that sits closest to the sun; the scalp.&nbsp; A hat is the perfect way to keep the terrible sun off your scalp without having to spend hours and hours shampooing SPF 30 out of your hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;A hat with a full brim will keep your head in the shade, no matter where you are, dramatically reducing the heat index directly around your head.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t dehydrate as fast and you will sweat less, both positive things if you find yourself by the side of a pool with a bikini-clad young lady in your company.&nbsp; Hats with fans built into the brim are considered novelties and I do not endorse them. </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account this vital function of the hat, you should choose a hat that you want to wear.&nbsp; This may sound silly, but how many times have you or someone you know bought an article of clothing, only to have it sit in your closet for years, hidden away like the tell-tale heart, beating softly, reminding you that you haven&rsquo;t worn it and probably never will.&nbsp; Ladies, I&rsquo;m looking at your shoe collections&hellip;.&nbsp; But a well-fitting, good-looking hat will not be a hard-earned dollar squandered.&nbsp; Besides choosing a hat that you like, make sure the style of the hat is appropriate for its season.&nbsp; For example, a light-colored, wide-brimmed straw panama hat is perfect for weekends down the shore, on the Cape, or however you describe your summer getaways so that everyone knows you&rsquo;ve been going for years and you&rsquo;re no rookie.&nbsp; Wear the same hat on a chilly fall evening - hats need not be worn only when the sun is out - and you&rsquo;ll wish you had gone ahead and purchased a second hat, something of wool or felt and a little heavier for keeping the soft autumn chill from cooling you too much.&nbsp; A light, wide-brimmed hat and a darker, smaller-brimmed job will do any gentleman just fine for whatever occasion should present itself.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you don&rsquo;t need to stop there.&nbsp; In warm weather you may be in the mood to don a lid for a hot dinner date at some BYOB you&rsquo;ve picked out because their menu focuses on local, seasonally available ingredients and what better way to show your dining partner that you appreciate the finer things in life, but aren&rsquo;t about to lose your shirt paying 400 percent markup on some bottle of wine, than by eating fresh, well-prepared food and drinking wine or beer that you took great care in selecting, not some beverage director or sommelier you&rsquo;ve never met, or worse, an inexperienced staff member whose song and dance steers you quite wrong and only leaves a bad taste in your mouth.&nbsp; For this situation, and others like it, consider a light, narrow-brimmed fedora.&nbsp; With this third item in your arsenal, you can tackle any situation, hat-related or not, that life throws at you.</span></p>
