<p class="style20">Lying.&nbsp; Naked.&nbsp; In a bed.&nbsp; Ceiling fan.&nbsp; Is this what happened to Van Norden? &nbsp;Is this where Boris ended up?&nbsp; Or is this the beginning?&nbsp; Is this the Villa Borghese?&nbsp; Where am I?<br />
  <br />
  1.<br />
  Last month I gave Alice the last I had lying around &ndash; there&rsquo;s a little more in the checking but she really has the last of it.&nbsp; The last cent is really just a figure of speak, it doesn&rsquo;t actually happen &ndash; no one goes broke, really broke.<br />
  <br />
  2.<br />
  Alice left with the last of it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a fucking cunt bitch, but I&rsquo;ve loved her or liked her for a hell of a long time so she&rsquo;s probably more of an angel just someone else&rsquo;s angel now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m reading, <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.<br />
  <br />
  3.<br />
  I haven&rsquo;t eaten in a week.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve eaten, but nothing you or I would consider a meal. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for myself.&nbsp; I only feel sorry for myself when I&rsquo;m eating.<br />
  <br />
  4.<br />
  I want to write the book, <em>One Thousand Years of Solitude</em>.<br />
  <br />
  5.<br />
  Fuck Alice.&nbsp; I met Jess the other day, or Jessica &ndash; Jessica Jones &ndash; JJ &ndash; and we had sex for an hour, then I talked for an hour, then we ate a meal, my first in a week, then we slept for one hour, then we had sex (four times) until the sun came back up.<br />
  <br />
  6.<br />
  Jessica Jones has a terrible name, JD&rsquo;s a better one, JD Salinger, I don&rsquo;t really like JJ, but it isn&rsquo;t because we&rsquo;re no longer having sex.&nbsp; I had sex with Tony Baloney a few days ago, and that&rsquo;s what you might call curiosity.&nbsp; When Jess found out she told me I was disgusting, or a pervert, or a fagot, I think she said: you&rsquo;re a disgusting pervert fagot &ndash; but I don&rsquo;t care, and since cutting things with Jess I haven&rsquo;t seen Tony again either.<br />
  <br />
  7.<br />
  I met Tony Baloney at Moby Dick&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Moby Dick&rsquo;s is a gay bar.&nbsp; I picked him up, but he approached me first.&nbsp; I still haven&rsquo;t seen Tony, and I haven&rsquo;t been back to Moby Dick&rsquo;s, the gay fagot bar.<br />
  <br />
  8.<br />
  I&rsquo;ve been writing a lot.&nbsp; A friend of mine told me he was writing 1000 words a day.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s writing a science fiction novel.&nbsp; I think I write 500 words a day, I don&rsquo;t keep track, but after talking to my friend I now write 1100 words a day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m writing what they call: literary fiction, or crap, mostly it&rsquo;s about Alice&rsquo;s cunt, and Jess&rsquo;s cunt, and how Jess&rsquo;s cunt is better than Alice&rsquo;s, and about Tony and how his cock is better than two cunts put together.&nbsp; Maybe I&rsquo;ve eaten one decent meal since seeing Jess.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t miss Alice anymore and I don&rsquo;t miss eating.<br />
  <br />
  9.<br />
  Sunsets are like appetites there will always be another, unless the day you miss it is the day you die.&nbsp; Then it would be your final sunset, your final appetite, and hopefully you were on the California coast and you ordered the Fulton Valley Roasted Chicken with buttermilk potatoes, glazed carrots, lemon thyme, and oven-dried cherry tomatoes.<br />
  <br />
  10.<br />
  I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about food, and Alice has come back to my thoughts too.&nbsp; I feel lonelier without food.<br />
  <br />
  11.<br />
  I wrote ten pages yesterday.&nbsp; I want to lay all ten of them in front of my friend and tell him that&rsquo;s what I can do when I feel like doing it.&nbsp; What I wrote about I do not know.<br />
  <br />
  12.<br />
  Do writers develop calluses on their fingers?&nbsp; I write so much I haven&rsquo;t seen the sun in three days.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m writing a fuck you letter, or some sort of epic poem to all the other writers out there in America.&nbsp; I feel like the only writer left.&nbsp; People started going home over an hour ago &ndash; I&rsquo;m Nicholas Ray.&nbsp; What will become of me if I never stop writing and never eat another decent meal?<br />
  <br />
  13.<br />
  Day two of not sleeping.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve cut out everything I no longer need.&nbsp; Whatever I&rsquo;m writing (<em>One Thousand Years of Solitude</em> I hope, or the next Steinbeck story about the rich and dusty Californian valley&rsquo;s) is looking more and more like a love letter to Alice and less like anything else.&nbsp; I wish I knew where to find Tony Baloney.&nbsp; He has the best cock in California.&nbsp; Tony&rsquo;s Mexican I think, or Peruvian or Salvadorian &ndash; he has a wonderfully sharp featured face, noodles for arms, and a small paunchy stomach &ndash; he looks like the singer of a great band only 10 people know about.&nbsp; I went to Moby Dick&rsquo;s last night but didn&rsquo;t see Tony.&nbsp; I drank two drinks and went home.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how I paid for the drinks.&nbsp; Someone must&rsquo;ve got it for me &ndash; an older guy &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have money anymore.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m reminded that Alice has all my money &ndash; it&rsquo;s been a lifetime, or else a week, since I&rsquo;ve thought about it: the money, I thought about Alice yesterday.<br />
  <br />
  14.<br />
  Everyone I know probably thinks I&rsquo;m dead.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t been outside in a week.&nbsp; I hope they kick the door down and see me writing, my fingers callused, my face like Willem Defoe.<br />
  <br />
  15.<br />
  As it always happens, someone eventually came into the story with a gun.&nbsp; In this story, John Henry walked into the apartment next to mine with a gun.&nbsp; I heard the first two shots go off and didn&rsquo;t even move.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m on page 250 of my love letter to no one.&nbsp; I assumed the sounds of gunshots were gunshots, but gunshots in my head not real ones.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t hear the rest of the shots (there were as many shots as fit into a pistol).&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t hear the shots because I stopped listening to the sounds in my head.&nbsp; I learned how to stop listening to the sounds in my head over the last few weeks.&nbsp; I wonder if I&rsquo;ll be a shaman someday.&nbsp; A shaman or a guru.<br />
  <br />
  16.<br />
  Because the gunshots were not in my head but real I had to move out of my apartment.&nbsp; Some of the bullets from John Henry&rsquo;s pistol went through my wall and into my couch, which means I could&rsquo;ve been killed if I didn&rsquo;t spent every minute of my life writing at my desk.&nbsp; My desk is near the window.&nbsp; I now believe in nothing more than the whale-sized crap I&rsquo;m writing, because only it has shown the literal power of saving my life.&nbsp; I told myself if I wasn&rsquo;t writing I would certainly be dead.<br />
  <br />
  Apparently, John Henry shot and killed my neighbors.&nbsp; Either they owed him money, or he owed them money and didn&rsquo;t want to pay up, or he had fucked my neighbor at one time, which I think he had, and didn&rsquo;t like the new guy she was fucking now, or he was insane.&nbsp; Whatever the reason the two collegiate-looking neighbors to the right of my flat plus a boyfriend who was staying the night were dead.<br />
  <br />
  17.<br />
  I wanted to sleep on the street the other day. &nbsp;I have everything I need, some books, paper, my notes, every single whale-shit page I&rsquo;ve written, and it&rsquo;s really starting to stack up, but the streets wouldn&rsquo;t have me.&nbsp; Instead I headed over to Jess&rsquo;s place and she let me in and told me I could crash for a couple of nights.&nbsp; Jess probably thinks a lot of things about me; men who fuck men and fanaticize about women are bohemians.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think a single thing about Jess.&nbsp; Jess asked me if I still wanted to fuck guys and I said no but really meant yes.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t say yes, even though I wanted to, because I started to get comfortable, forgetting about the hours when I wanted to live in the streets, and I thought Jess might kick me out, which she eventually did anyway when I told her I didn&rsquo;t want to sleep with her, that in fact I didn&rsquo;t really close my eyes anymore, and that instead of sleeping with her I would spent the night writing while she wasted her time sleeping.&nbsp; So much for friends, I think I said as I grabbed all my stuff (I could carry it pretty easily, it wasn&rsquo;t much) and walked down the steps to the street.&nbsp; Go find your boyfriend asshole I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d go to bed with him and fuck his ass, Jess shouted before slamming the door shut behind her.<br />
  <br />
  18.<br />
  I&rsquo;m lying on my back staring at the ceiling fan and the shades on the window are drawn just enough so that the sunlight barely illuminates the room.&nbsp; The bed is comfortable.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m naked and there are no sheets covering me, thought I&rsquo;m not cold.&nbsp; I stare down at my penis to make sure it&rsquo;s still there.&nbsp; If Tony opened the bedroom door like the precious but cheap artist he is, I would smile and then yell at him like women yell at men, or in this case how men yell at gay men.&nbsp; I wait for the door to open.&nbsp; But no one opens the bedroom door, and I lie there for a while on the bed and stare at the ceiling fan.&nbsp; A gentle breeze from the fan blows against me and I can&rsquo;t think about anything but profound blankness for what seems like hours then days.<br />
  <br />
  My book, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m calling it now, is lying on the ground beside the bed.&nbsp; The papers are strewn about but the pages looks to be in some kind of order &ndash; the right order.&nbsp; I still don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m writing about, so I try to think about what I&rsquo;m writing, see if I can make sense of what I&rsquo;ve already done, squeeze some sense into what I&rsquo;ve got down already, picture what perhaps it might become.&nbsp; After what seems like thirty minutes, but could be a week, I give up and decide that I am for sure not an editor and most likely a writer.&nbsp; I tell myself writers don&rsquo;t need to know what they&rsquo;re writing about, that writing about something is enough, and I wholeheartedly agree.<br />
  <br />
The sun goes down and I don&rsquo;t get up and never once leave the bed, and no one ever opens the bedroom door.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t need to go to the bathroom anymore because I don&rsquo;t eat, and I don&rsquo;t close my eyes anymore because I don&rsquo;t sleep.&nbsp; I stare at the ceiling fan and from time to time check on my penis, and I dream about Alice and everything I&rsquo;ve ever known and all the people I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to and all the places and rooms I&rsquo;ve ever been in.&nbsp; And within my dream my eyes eventually close, and somewhere in my mind I picture my book, bound like a real book, with the right binding and correct lettering, and Alice has her face in it, her eyes are open and green, and her face looks like she&rsquo;s been holding off a rapturous fart for hours at a family dining table in Hoboken.</p>

  After writing and then eating I go outside to the pool and meet a young girl under a big yellow sun, and she is happy and smiling when I say, passing by her to lay down my towel: that book you&rsquo;re reading, it looks like one of those &ndash; and then I said something funny.&nbsp; The book is, <em>The History of Love</em>.&nbsp; She is not ALL smiles.&nbsp; She would not smile, say, if I told her her arms looked fat, or are fat, which they aren&rsquo;t fat, but instead perfectly thin, slender and matching the color of her legs.<br />
  <br />
  This is what comedy looks like:<br />
  - Hello.<br />
  - Hi.<br />
  - What book are you reading?<br />
  - <em>The History of the Love</em> (1st smile).<br />
  - I&rsquo;ve never seen you here before.<br />
  - Oh, well, I don&rsquo;t live here.&nbsp; I&hellip;<br />
  - What book is it did you say?<br />
  - <em>The History of Love</em> (smile)?<br />
  - Did a woman write it?<br />
  - Yes (smile).<br />
  - That&rsquo;s funny.<br />
  - Why (smile)?<br />
  - I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s probably an Oprah club-book selection.<br />
  - I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip; (smile).<br />
  - How do you know?<br />
  - I guess I don&rsquo;t (smile).<br />
  - You smile a lot.&nbsp; Is it one of those sappy, unrealistic love stories?&nbsp; It is isn&rsquo;t it?<br />
  - No (smile).<br />
  - Does the hero have long blonde hair?&nbsp; Let me see the cover.&nbsp; Does he look like Brad Pitt in <em>Legends of the Fall</em>?&nbsp; He does, right?<br />
  - No!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not like that at all (smile)!</p>
<p class="style20">2.<br />
Alice called and we had dinner and then had sex.</p>
<p class="style20">3.<br />
  I walked to the bookstore to look for a book Marcus, an old friend of mine, told me I needed to read.&nbsp; The book was <em>The Dangerous Eye</em> by Emmanuel Flores.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t find it.&nbsp; I ask one of the clerks at the counter if he&rsquo;s heard of it and he says no and we walk around for a while and found nothing by Flores.&nbsp; The clerk tells me I&rsquo;d be better off reading Philip K. Dick, because he is a real writer.&nbsp; I ask the clerk if he knows anything about Emmanuel Flores.&nbsp; He says, no.&nbsp; After a while he asks if I want to go to another bookstore he owns on the other side of town, he could call and see if they have the book there.&nbsp; I say no, that it didn&rsquo;t make much sense if I can&rsquo;t find it in this store.<br />
I walk down the street five blocks or so and come to another bookstore, selling used books, and inside I find two books by Flores, <em>The Dangerous Eye</em>, which I immediately open up and read the first page and am excited about, and, <em>The First of September</em>, which is a bit longer but also looks good.&nbsp; I pay the shopkeeper ten dollars and leave.</p>
<p class="style20">4.<br />
Daniel and I go out for drinks and eventually meet two drunken girls at the Hooting Owl and take them home with us when we leave.&nbsp; We go back to Daniel&rsquo;s flat, which is closer to the bar, and I drive because I drank the least.&nbsp; Daniel calls me a lightweight.&nbsp; The Hooting Owl was the third bar we stopped in; the one Daniel said he always has the most luck with.&nbsp; Though, he also says he&rsquo;s gotten lucky in them all at one time or another.&nbsp; And then he stops himself, in front of the girls, and says it is all bullshit and that he never got lucky, that it is all skill, and it&rsquo;s only some kind of evil anti-luck, or phantom unbalance within the world and his that stops him the nights he doesn&rsquo;t take someone home.&nbsp; And he shouts this in front of the girls, and the one Daniel is going to have sex with smiles, looking at him intently, and laughs.</p>
<p class="style20">5.<br />
At the pool again today and I see the young girl once more.&nbsp; She looks prettier than before.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s laid out on a chaise lounge sunbathing and not reading.&nbsp; I try all day to think of a way to get near enough to kiss her and come up with nothing.&nbsp; I get frustrated when I ask her if she wants to see me the next day and she tells me she has plans already and she doesn&rsquo;t say exactly what they are.&nbsp; But thank you, she says.&nbsp; I realize then I&rsquo;ve been over-thinking the whole thing from the beginning and decide trying to have sex with her would be just as efficient.&nbsp; We exchange numbers.</p>
<p class="style20">6.<br />
Daniel calls and asks if the girl from the other night, the one I was with, has called me.&nbsp; I say no.&nbsp; He says she likes me and tells me to call her and then hangs up.</p>
<p class="style20">7.<br />
I read the first 100 pages of <em>The Dangerous Eye</em> and I enjoy it.&nbsp; I read 200 pages of <em>The First of September</em> and I like it better.</p>
<p class="style20">8.<br />
Daniel calls and asks if I want to go back to the bar where we picked up the girls from the other night.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to invite Simone, the girl he brought home that night.&nbsp; I tell him it sounds defeating to take the girls we just met back to the same place we just met them.&nbsp; Daniel asks me if I&rsquo;ve heard from the girl I was with yet.&nbsp; I say yes to shut him up.&nbsp; Then I tell him I think I&rsquo;m in love with someone and Daniel asks who, the girl from the other night, already?, and then he laughs.&nbsp; I say no, a girl I met the other day at the pool.&nbsp; Sounds promising, he says &ndash; so do you want to see these girls or not, I can get Simone to call the other one for you?&nbsp; They're friends, he reminds me.&nbsp; I ask if he&rsquo;s read<em> The Dangerous Eye</em>?&nbsp; Yeah, last year, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p class="style20">9.<br />
Alice came over and we talked about Emmanuel Flores for two hours.&nbsp; I did all of the talking and used Alice as a backboard.&nbsp; Then we had sex.</p>
<p class="style20">10.<br />
  All I&rsquo;m doing is reading Flores and thinking about the girl from the pool.&nbsp; Alice came over and I hid in my bedroom and cut out the lights.&nbsp; She rang the doorbell three times, I waited, then she slipped a note under the door and left.<br />
  <br />
  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came by at 2&rsquo;oclock.&nbsp; I wish you were here.&nbsp; I saw the lights turn off in your room.&nbsp; I think someone&rsquo;s hiding in your flat.&nbsp; If so they&rsquo;ll probably take this note and throw it away because I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s one of the girls you&rsquo;ve brought home with you.&nbsp; All the girls you leave at your place are whores.</em><br />
  <br />
I read the note twice then throw it in the garbage.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see Alice again for a month.</p>
<p class="style20">11.<br />
I finish<em> The First of September</em>.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t finish <em>The Dangerous Eye</em>.&nbsp; <em>The Dangerous Eye</em> is good, but it isn&rsquo;t great.&nbsp; <em>The First of September</em> is great.&nbsp; I meet Marcus for a drink and we discuss Emmanuel Flores and the two books. I lie and tell Marcus I&rsquo;ve read them both.&nbsp; We argue over<em> The Dangerous Eye</em> and I stay within the first 100 pages (bad beginning and it never gets better) and don&rsquo;t go too far and blow my cover.&nbsp; Marcus gets angry and calls me an asshole then pays our tab and leaves.&nbsp; I drank three Pernods. &nbsp;Before hitting the door, Marcus says he&rsquo;s paid for my chick drinks then he walks out onto a street bathed in a sunset orange light.</p>
<p class="style20">12.<br />
  I got to thinking about what Marcus said about Flores and<em> The Dangerous Eye</em> and I decide it is idiotic not to finish the whole thing, but I&rsquo;d already given the book away and didn&rsquo;t have the money to buy it back.<br />
  I sat in a wood dining table I&rsquo;d carried outside in front of my flat and thought about Flores, the girl I&rsquo;d met with Daniel (who since Daniel gave her my number hadn&rsquo;t stopped calling me), Alice (but only briefly, wondering where she was and if I&rsquo;d ever see her again), and the girl from the pool.&nbsp; I thought longest about her and what Marcus had said about Flores, about the short and adventurous life of writers we admired, and other romantic things.&nbsp; Then I got to thinking about desire and how honest of a feeling it is.&nbsp; I thought about how love is cried daily and desire not, and how in love there&rsquo;s corruption and religion and in desire nothing.</p>
<p class="style20">13.<br />
  Everyone died today: Alice (drugs, pills I think), the girl I met with Daniel (car accident), Daniel and the girl he met the same night, with whom he was now living (car accident, Daniel was driving his 95&rsquo; Ford Thunderbird), Marcus (pneumonia or double pneumonia), the girl from the pool (blood clot after a bad fall from a steep hike), and Flores (psoriasis).<br />
  I was shot at recently in Mexico but lived.&nbsp; A bullet grazed my left arm and one went in my back and out my right shoulder.&nbsp; Nothing serious was hit and I was stitched and bandaged on my back and some screws where put into my shoulder to keep it together and then it too was stitched and bandaged.<br />
  Recently, I met someone in Mexico who lent me a copy of Flores&rsquo;<em> The Dangerous Eye</em>.&nbsp; It was handed to me easily like it hadn&rsquo;t been read and there was no intention to open it.&nbsp; The copy I was lent, though I think it safe to say it was given, had not been translated, but I do well reading Spanish.&nbsp; I read it cover to cover.&nbsp; If Marcus weren&rsquo;t dead we would finish our argument.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say that Marcus is right, but now I understand the points he made referring to the places in the book I hadn&rsquo;t read.<br />
  Flores wrote five books, one good one, one great one, and three others.&nbsp; In the great one, the hero loses everything, but he is reminded that through mystery comes acceptance, and through courage comes desire, and through desire comes mystery, and in the end a circle is made.&nbsp; In the good one, all the same still applies, all the same ideas, but in the end the hero receives everything he&rsquo;s wanted, life shows to him its beauty, and he confirms that everything in essentially everything, and that ultimately what matters most is happiness, not knowledge, and he will live by this credo alone moving on.&nbsp; He learns all he can, and in the end there is nothing more obvious than irony, that none of what he has since learned matters greatly, only that happiness is obtainable.<br />
I talk to one of my new Mexican friends and he says I need to forget about what has happened to me and remember that I&rsquo;m breathing.&nbsp; He says that some things matter and some don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We discuss it and I try to find a way to take the other side and we share a horchata.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/trieste.jpg" width="462" height="640" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Walking  out I take a final look.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way  it is: ass first and questions later.&nbsp;  Ass is never last &ndash; no &ndash; it&rsquo;s first.&nbsp;  So it&rsquo;s always like this.&nbsp; And ass  is the same with Jackson too.&nbsp; Even with  him, even with Jackson, these things are exactly the same &ndash; they are identical.<br />
  I  like to order a drink before dinner but Jackson stays away from it.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t like the stuff screwing with his  head.&nbsp; For all these nights and days he&rsquo;s  kept a sharp head; kept it sharp atop his shoulders with the eraser at this  feet.&nbsp; He uses a sharpener.<br />
  <br />
Someone  mentioned the <strong>Beluga Bar</strong> &ndash; and now  we&rsquo;re hitting it hard.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s nice &ndash; you  know &ndash; hitting it hard.&nbsp; One takes pride,  or else one should, whenever he and his fellows are hitting it hard.&nbsp; I was thinking along these lines, ordering  and finishing the drinks as they came to me.&nbsp;  Jackson wasn&rsquo;t hitting it at all.&nbsp;  Jackson, before I knew him, before Paris, before the many years&hellip; had  been a quiet little chap.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d been a  university chap; he read Steinbeck and Faulkner.</p>
<p class="style2">So Jackson  and I are together and again in Trieste &ndash; no &ndash; me and Jackson are in Trieste,  together.&nbsp; One followed the other (<strong>grammatically</strong>).</p>
<p class="style2">I take  a final look at the girl behind the counter.&nbsp;  Jackson is still in between the stacks, sifting through them &ndash; doing the  butterfly.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s looking for a book  written by an author.&nbsp; He wants the right  kind of story and he doesn&rsquo;t want the selected poetry.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t like poetry and the authors who  write it.&nbsp; Jackson doesn&rsquo;t like when they  add it to the beginning; he doesn&rsquo;t like a fluff-up.&nbsp; Occasionally he gets fluffed, but he&rsquo;s choosy  about it.&nbsp; He never chooses the ones that  I could &ndash; so we do not carry with us the same numbers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl behind the counter turns her head,  slightly cocking it to the right, and I walk outside.&nbsp; She lifts her hand and pushes the loose  strands of hair behind her ear.&nbsp; As I  pass through the doors a woman &ndash; no &ndash; an elderly woman, points at me with a  very long finger.&nbsp; She wants someone in  the foyer, anyone at all, to know that I&rsquo;m carrying a gift under my shirt.&nbsp; She looks a bit senile to me; she seems to be  too, though I don&rsquo;t know much about it.&nbsp;  I do not talk to many senile girls.&nbsp;  In fact, I mean not to, which is to say, I haven&rsquo;t at all.<br />
<br />
 I smoke a cigarette and look out at the  water.&nbsp; The sun is up and the water looks  cool and inviting.&nbsp; Half a thousand  people walk by with hats on.&nbsp; Some of the  tourists have umbrellas and I wonder to myself why they don&rsquo;t just read Joyce  and stay at home.&nbsp; The Italians go to  Split for vacation, but the Croatians never visit Trieste.&nbsp; No one knows why.&nbsp; I think it may be a difference of culture &ndash;  this&rsquo;s what is said when nothing else can be.<br />
  Of  the half thousand, most walk about casually, up and down the shore, they walk  up and down the Corso Cavour with beads of sweet on their chin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a large window in front of the  store.&nbsp; I watch Jackson as he sifts  through the last stacks rising from the ground next to the wall.&nbsp; The girl behind the counter has short brown  hair.&nbsp; She is long and rounded at the tips  of her corners.&nbsp; Jackson might be too  busy to talk with her; he&rsquo;s that  focused on the book-fetching.&nbsp; When the elderly women &ndash; no &ndash; the senile lady  walks out I am going to flick the end of my cigarette at her feet, put my hands  in my pockets, and spit.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing  in my shirt but my passport.</p>
<p class="style2">Jackson  and I take a long lunch under the late afternoon sun.&nbsp; We take it on the front patio and both of us  look out at the water.&nbsp; The tourists  continue to stroll by and Jackson comments about the way some of &lsquo;em walk.&nbsp; I hate a bad walk, he says.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t ask him to explain it.<br />
  <br />
  The  waitress flirts with Jackson and I equally.&nbsp;  I don&rsquo;t pay it much attention, but when she speaks in English it arouses  me to hear the familiar words mispronounced.&nbsp;  It always comes to that, and again with the ass.&nbsp; Jackson thinks the young girl is the daughter  of the restaurant&rsquo;s owner &ndash; it&rsquo;s a family business, he says &ndash; he thinks the  father&rsquo;s name is: <strong>Tony.&nbsp; </strong>I go inside to use the bathroom and kiss  our waitress in the hallway leading back to the toilette.&nbsp; I can hear the pans and the motion of the  kitchen nearby &ndash; the smell of Jackson&rsquo;s fish on the way.&nbsp; The young girl&rsquo;s skin is dark and smooth from  the sun.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving I let her know where Jackson  and I are staying.&nbsp; She explains that her  place is close to ours and we make a plan to talk later in the night.&nbsp; I will come over, she says slowly.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll come over, I tell Jackson.</p>
<p class="style2">Later  in the evening Jackson and I walk down to the Corso with the girl from the  restaurant and a friend of hers.&nbsp; The two  live together.&nbsp; So now it&rsquo;s understood  that we&rsquo;re all going to bed with one another &ndash; one for Jackson and one for  me.&nbsp; Jackson&rsquo;s happy to get it out of the  way; he doesn&rsquo;t like leaving it up to chance.&nbsp;  I too am happy.&nbsp; There will be a  good show later and a swell coffee in the morning.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moon is full and bright and it lights  much of the town along with the streetlamps.&nbsp;  We walk down the Corso slowly, the two girls walking beside us.&nbsp; I tell the new girl that I wished I had met her  first &ndash; because you&rsquo;re beautiful, I explain to her.&nbsp; I want to kiss you, I say.&nbsp; Why would you say that, interjects Claudia &ndash;  Tony&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t like me, she  asks.&nbsp; She is mostly afraid I&rsquo;ve upset  the balance.&nbsp; I do, I say, but now I&rsquo;ve  already kissed one of you and can&rsquo;t the other.&nbsp;  I only mention it because she is so beautiful.&nbsp; And I am not beautiful, it is asked.&nbsp; I reach for her arm.&nbsp; Molto bella, I say past the tongue in my  mouth.&nbsp; If you kissed Jackson, I say to  her, I would be jealous.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claudia smiles then walks over to Jackson  and stretches up to kiss him.&nbsp; Under the  moon the Corso reflects like sunlight rippling in the shallows.&nbsp; Jackson and Claudia kiss long and  passionately.&nbsp; I ask her friend if she  was upset by what I said.&nbsp; She does not  say anything.&nbsp; Then she says: no.&nbsp; We are standing on a corner.&nbsp; She walks over to me and takes my hand.&nbsp; I lean down to kiss her and she reaches up to  run her fingers through my hair.</p>
<p class="style2">The  next day the two girls took Jackson and I to the Cinematografo Ariston.&nbsp; As always Jackson and I watched closely.</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Robert is black.&nbsp; He  sits on a chair in the lobby.&nbsp; The chair  is dull and weathered with a red velvet cushion on the seat.&nbsp; No one wants to sit in the antique chairs but  everyone who walks into the hotel stares and admires them.&nbsp; The chairs go mostly unoccupied because they  are uncomfortable.&nbsp; Keri said they&rsquo;re libel  to flatten her ass.&nbsp; These were no longer  the days of adjustment.&nbsp; Keri is nothing  other than a pretty girl.<br />
  <br />
Robert sits in his chair patiently;  he sits quietly and darkly.&nbsp; He is  alone.&nbsp; So dark is Robert&rsquo;s complexion  that if he were to close his eyes he would fade into the evening, he would  disappear into a shadow.&nbsp; He is black  like Scandinavians are white.&nbsp; His face  is as dark colored as there ever was a dark colored face, and his eyes are as  bright as there has ever been a bright pair of eyes.&nbsp; Robert leans heavily into the Victorian  chair, looking as though he might take a nap through the afternoon &ndash; there  didn&rsquo;t seem like much else to do.<br />
<br />
Robert&rsquo;s  last name is McClure.&nbsp; So he&rsquo;s Robert McClure.&nbsp; As a name it was nothing short of the  strangest I have ever heard for such a man.&nbsp;  For one, he didn&rsquo;t have the right figure for it, nor did he have the  frame; he hadn&rsquo;t the right posture and surely not the right balance for it  either.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t at all attached to  it.&nbsp; The rest of us would go on calling  him Robert or M. McClure and it wouldn&rsquo;t ever mean anything.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t stick to his like the rest  eventually stuck to theirs.&nbsp; It hadn&rsquo;t  grown on him like the others had grown into theirs.&nbsp; It was a fake name, and I thought for a while  it was, but it wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Simply, it  couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to attach itself; it wouldn&rsquo;t fall into place and maybe it  wouldn&rsquo;t ever.&nbsp; Everyone else in the  history of the world was, one way or another, fitted to their name, and yet  Robert McClure, sitting as he was, black as night and charcoal and ink, had  gone unnoticed, unfitted, unconnected where the rest of us were.</p>
<p class="style2">9:24.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Brioche and coffee fly through the lobby as  Robert sits idly.&nbsp; Suited.&nbsp; Tailored in Chiang Mai, by guys who know how to do it.&nbsp; Under the silks and buttons a holster drapes  around back, twists at the top, and swings across his right shoulder holding a  blade; his blade: a silver Colt .38 called, lovingly, the Pocket Hammer.&nbsp; Robert sits quietly.&nbsp; Things would happen.&nbsp; Things always did.<br />
  <br />
  Ethiopian dark and French  manicured, Robert was a sign of a time, not <em>the</em> times; he raises his hand and orders a coffee from the passing help.&nbsp; He stares across the lobby to the front  desk.&nbsp; Across the lobby stood Keri: 20&rsquo;s,  stranger in a foreign land, too blonde, too curious, sculpted curves in the back  and plenty of fat between the ears.&nbsp;  Standing passionately, she waits near the hotel courtesy phone.&nbsp; Robert watches, his eyes trained and  centered. &nbsp;Before he blinks Keri reaches  for the cream colored handle and blows: give me an outside line, into the  receiver.<br />
  <br />
  Some deals go down and some  don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Robert knew that.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d known it for as long as he could  remember.&nbsp; And it was in these years, the  next few to be his final, that Robert found he had no respect for those who  didn&rsquo;t understand what was meant by it.&nbsp;  Keri was going to make her deal or she wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She would receive a package or she  wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He was here, sitting idly, the  nose of his blade resting cool against his breast, to make sure she got less  than she wanted.&nbsp; In the end, at the  right moment, it would be he or she.&nbsp;  (5/2, 4/1.)&nbsp; Those were the odds &ndash;  bookie&rsquo;s numbers.&nbsp; And at any moment the  revolving front door would turn quicker than usual.&nbsp; Five, maybe six Moroccans walking through  dressed in fake Armani costumes.&nbsp; Street  thugs.&nbsp; Hired clowns.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be he or she.&nbsp; This was the way it always was.<br />
  <br />
  Everyone dies and everyone takes a  breath &ndash; everyone lives for a moment.&nbsp;  Robert nudges his coffee and fingers the handle.&nbsp; Leaning over he rests the cup in front of him  on the table.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m watching you, he  says.&nbsp; Cream colored phone, lips,  receiver, curves in the back, hair straight and long; something rustling in the  air: lavender and Ibrahim Ferrer.&nbsp; Robert  rests back against his chair.&nbsp; Who pays  for what?&nbsp; One eyelid falls.&nbsp; Lights out.&nbsp;  Siesta.</p>
<p class="style2">Robert was nothing if he wasn&rsquo;t proper about the way he went  about his daily life.&nbsp; It began with his  preference for sturdy-brimmed hats, well-fitted trousers, a penchant for  leisurely wandering, and a respect for one&rsquo;s overall tidiness and tightly  groomed facial hair.&nbsp; A modern man with  general technological savoir, yet studiously aware and attracted to the classics,  Robert sat quietly in one of the many red velvet chairs in the grand lobby of  the H&ocirc;tel de Crillon.<br />
  <br />
   The men who  came before him, the ones he most admired, liked to entertain themselves by  having casual conversations with women.&nbsp;  Keri was sitting by her lonesome on this day &ndash; the day he too was  sitting, both casually and properly postured, enjoying a very dark and rich  caf&eacute;.&nbsp; <em>Sans Sucre</em>.&nbsp; He had asked the  gar&ccedil;on for no sugar.&nbsp; It was his belief  that all true man of the world found little need to muddy good coffee with  condiments.&nbsp; This same rule applied to  two other very important services as well &ndash; meat was to be served in only its  own blood with perhaps a simple dollop of garlic butter on top, and all drinks,  all real ones, were to be enjoyed with the least amount of fuss &ndash; from the  barman&rsquo;s bottle to the glass, sometimes over rocks.&nbsp; Robert was comfortable handling a  miscellaneous mixture of French words and phrases.&nbsp; He moved his tongue confidently into the  right positions, something he assumed all men should be capable of  handling.&nbsp; As a practice is was simply a  question of tongue and vowels.<br />
  <br />
  Keri sat very quietly making  Robert&rsquo;s approach all the more planned.&nbsp;  He waited for the gar&ccedil;on to pass by and then he raised two fingers in  the air, side by side, and announced his request for the check.&nbsp; As the reply from the boy tailed away in the  great hall, he turned to Keri who was already looking back at him.&nbsp; All voices in the grand lobby echoed and like  all women in that part of the city she could not help from locating its source.<br />
  <br />
 Lightly rubbing  his fingers together, dusting off the two he had used to earlier finger his  biscuit, Robert traversed the few chairs between he and Keri and took a seat in  the chair next to hers.&nbsp; Well accustomed  to talking in this way, and terribly well versed in the art of first sentences,  he asked if she would like to join him for an early lunch &ndash; something which had  yet to become a trend.</p>

<p><strong>History and First Recorded Mention: </strong>In the days of creation he was very  lonely and others referred to him as the uneducated one.&nbsp; He sat as they continued to file out like  turnips, one rolling over the other.&nbsp; Who  was bothered by turnips?&nbsp; But that was  the very reason he left, and he rationalized this by explaining to the fallen  that they, not him, were imbeciles of the greatest order.&nbsp; This would be his first feeling, and though  it was a good one he would forget to write it down. &nbsp;Not long after he arrived in Rabat he would  loose all memory of those first days.&nbsp;  And it was here, among the new and less absurd, that he read his first  books and was asked his first questions.&nbsp;  His answers, however, were slow and meditative in the beginning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;re in the room, Jackson and me.&nbsp; (Why the hell is Jackson just sitting there?)  I am thinking along these lines when he stands up and goes to the snack machine  and throws in some coins from his pocket.&nbsp;  He stands at the snack machine, fidgeting with his phone, pushing the  buttons carefully and slightly swaying back and forth like the Lakers during  the anthem.&nbsp; Everything fits snug to his  body &ndash; his t-shirt has the logo of a sunrise on the back near the neckline.&nbsp; It has a sort of hippy quality to it.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t  cold but I have on my jacket anyway.&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s a new jacket, one I bought the other day with the money I made for  an article I wrote.&nbsp; The article isn&rsquo;t  very good at all.&nbsp; I felt that in order  to amuse myself I should try to write an article I didn&rsquo;t like and sell it for  money.&nbsp; I did so laughing, and I sold it  to a businessman, who, as the story goes, was quite sure of himself and very  confident in his dealings.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  When we met  he presented himself as much the man for the job; he was the business type with  all the attributes that made him so: leather briefcase, square shoulders,  strong handshake, gym membership, crew cut hairdo.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d asked me specifically for one article  and I had written him one.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d shaken  hands on the matter.&nbsp; It was a very fine  understanding and now I had my jacket &ndash; and of course he was on his way to the  printers with my terrible article.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Whenever I do freelance work I make  sure to give them the name Henry Dickson.&nbsp;  All the businessmen I&rsquo;ve ever known love that name.<br />
  <br />
- Say, said Jackson still standing  in front of the snack machine.&nbsp; He  carefully fit his phone back into his pocket.&nbsp;  The other hand dove in the back pocket of his pants, fingering some  change.&nbsp; He was staring glumly at the  cellophane Danish in E4.&nbsp; I was in my  seat; I crossed my hands and felt the texture of my jacket.</p>
<p class="style2">Four hours ago Jackson and I walked out the Crystalline Theatre  with S.</p>
<p class="style2">- Is it her?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s  tall, Jackson said.<br />
  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  He said it close to my ear.&nbsp; S was walking toward us quickly.&nbsp; She had taken the #4 train.&nbsp; Jackson and I were waiting for her out front  of the theatre near the ticket booth.&nbsp; I  told Jackson I thought it a good idea to wait outside &ndash; he could have a look at  her, I said.&nbsp; I mentioned to him that she  was something to look at.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Standing there we discussed  niceties, hers and others, keeping it very general and straight &ndash; and as broad  as we kept it I still found myself leaning into long descriptions of S and  always verging on a story.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s really  something, I said; I said this at the end of our talk, for punctuation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  But however nice she was, she was  also tall, and this bothered Jackson because he was short in the legs.&nbsp; If he couldn&rsquo;t see into her eyes he would  have to be rude to her &ndash; he&rsquo;d have to try and ignore her and keep to himself.&nbsp; And so that was what he did, looking at her  lips instead of her eyes, because that was where he and she lined up.<br />
  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the  film, Mario Kasun&rsquo;s cocky tale of human <br />
contortionists (a directorial debut), I  couldn&rsquo;t help from wondering how S was taking it all in.&nbsp; There was lots of grunting, pushing and  punching, and the subtitles were flying by the screen at one furious pace.&nbsp; As the screen flickered I stole looks at  Jackson who was well fixed and taking most of it in.&nbsp; He only occasionally stole looks of his own,  reserving these for quick glances of S&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp;  I could see he&rsquo;d begun to get used to them being around.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While the punching raged on I  continued to take my looks around the room.&nbsp;  Somewhere in the middle I decided S wasn&rsquo;t getting any of it.&nbsp; I was sure she didn&rsquo;t understand why there  were so many uneven sequences, if she&rsquo;d even understood they were uneven at all  &ndash; and she wanted to ask me why all the grunting, though, she never asked this  question.&nbsp; She was afraid to ask.&nbsp; As I thought about S and her loneliness, the  film continuing its direction, I came to the idea that Kasun was just too damn  clever for her &ndash; and very likely too outspoken.&nbsp;  Everything Kasun put on the screen seemed to slap S across the face like  it was attached to an axe handle.&nbsp; This,  I thought til the end credits, is the way it is.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the line of credits finally  finished and the lights went on we got up and left.&nbsp; The three of us walked down the steps  together like a trio of friendly acquaintances.&nbsp;  At the bottom of the steps we hung a right and walked down a long  corridor which led to the larger river that washed us outside.&nbsp; S walked in front of me and Jackson in front  of her.&nbsp; Every single layer, all her  parts and her corners, were set in their rightful place.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d been molded cleanly and  mathematically.&nbsp; Nothing, not a single  scrap on her frame, was unordinary or unique.&nbsp;  And all of this got me to wondering again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside we clustered back together,  S in the middle, and Jackson and I on either side of her.&nbsp; We walked together down the street  casually.&nbsp; Neither Jackson nor I were in  any hurry to get her back to the train.<br />
<br />
- What did you think of the  film?&nbsp; I asked this because we were  nearing the station and the three of us had walked together in almost complete  silence.&nbsp; Jackson had kept his word and  was not talking.&nbsp; Though it was obvious  he enjoyed to spy and glance when he felt like doing so.&nbsp; He could&rsquo;ve talked to her from the side, kept  his head down, but he&rsquo;d decided already that he wouldn&rsquo;t.<br />
- I don&rsquo;t know, she said.&nbsp; She too felt the train was near and our time  would be shortly over.<br />
- You didn&rsquo;t care for it.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that right?<br />
- No I didn&rsquo;t, she said.&nbsp; But you shouldn&rsquo;t be angry.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t usually like foreign films.<br />
- I&rsquo;m not angry, I said.&nbsp; Of course I <em>was</em> angry, but not in a way S could understand quickly.&nbsp; And our time was ever getting shorter.<br />
- I guess it&rsquo;s just that I didn&rsquo;t  read everything.&nbsp; It was too complicated  and I stopped paying attention.&nbsp; This  caught me by surprise, as I had imagined her staring up at the screen without  flinching, without so much as blinking an eye &ndash; or thinking of Jackson and I.<br />
Then Jackson spoke up &ndash; the scream  of the train now clear in the distance.&nbsp;  <br />
-
I didn&rsquo;t get it either, he said.</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later S and I were on a similar walk.&nbsp; Jackson was away on holiday in  Valparaiso.&nbsp; We headed south, strolling  down 4th street to pick up lunch and bring it back to the office.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - What do  you think of it all?&nbsp; How do you find it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Find  what?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I&rsquo;m not  sure.&nbsp; All of it I guess.&nbsp; Do you want any children?&nbsp; There were plenty of pauses in between.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Yes, I  want them.&nbsp; And you?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want them do you?&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t have asked otherwise.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - No, I do  want them.&nbsp; I just don&rsquo;t think about  it.&nbsp; I imagine you think about it all the  time.&nbsp; Is that one of the things you  do?&nbsp; These questions were coming out so  genuinely &ndash; everything was in earnest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I think  about it.&nbsp; More than you I guess.&nbsp; I&hellip;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped  her right there.&nbsp; We were on the corner  at the stoplight and I reached out to grab her arm.&nbsp; She turned &ndash; everything lined up against each  other.&nbsp; I said I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I was  doing and she said she knew exactly what she wanted.&nbsp;  Her path was clear in front of her.&nbsp;  It isn&rsquo;t much of a path, I said.&nbsp;  It frustrated me to feel such a confidence from her.&nbsp; I said it bothered me; such paths of clarity  are never real and almost always fake.&nbsp;  Instead of fake I said: faux.&nbsp;  There&rsquo;re so many of you, she said.&nbsp;  I denied it.&nbsp; There are thousands  of you, she said, always fighting and never winning.&nbsp; I said there was millions of her.&nbsp; I said there were easily a thousand girls in  every town who looked and thought as basically as she did.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t true, she said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That  evening I received a letter from Jackson.&nbsp;  Inside was a picture of the beach.&nbsp;  Lying on his side Jackson looked up at the camera, two of the most  beautiful girls I had ever seen lay on either side of him.&nbsp; Underneath the picture he wrote: have you  been talking to S?</p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/check still.jpg" width="360" height="332" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style14">I have lost my voice.  I have lost my ears.</p>
<p class="style14">I cannot I cannot see you.</p>
<p class="style15">&hellip;I got you caught up in the rapture<br />
  make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya<br />
  girl don't be so frantic I&rsquo;m just a hopeless romantic &ndash; don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic<br />
  you can't ignore it &ndash; so don't just stand before it &ndash; just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin' &ndash; damn shorty &ndash; I told you this was bound to happen &ndash; soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and throw your spine out of alignment<br />
  I&rsquo;mma hang a sign up, sayin&rsquo; don't disturb<br />
  shorty I&rsquo;m so superb &ndash; I say the right things &ndash; don't I spit the dopest words&hellip;</p>
<p class="style14">I don&rsquo;t know, what prose&hellip;</p>
<p class="style14">Jackson stole me.  He got me into it.  He and I are out together and we&rsquo;re lost.</p>
<p class="style14">I&rsquo;m in the bedroom.  Jackson is in the alley outside.  Someone said they were carryin&rsquo;.  They were: carryin&rsquo;.  They were fuckin carryin &ndash; and now Jackson is outside in the back. He went with the ole Swede.  The Swede isn&rsquo;t carryin; he wants to teach Jackson how to look like a boxer.</p>
<p class="style14">I&rsquo;m in the bedroom:</p>
<p class="style14">-	Why are you here?<br />
  -	I&rsquo;m with you.  I&rsquo;m with you, she said.<br />
  -	Where&rsquo;s Jackson?<br />
  -	He&rsquo;s outside.<br />
  -	Are you two together &ndash; are you together or something?<br />
  -	Yes.</p>
<p class="style15">&hellip;Cadillacs &ndash; Coupe Devilles &ndash; brain dead rims yeah stupid wheels<br />
  girl I&rsquo;m too for real<br />
  lose your tooth and nails &ndash; try to fight it &ndash; try to deny it<br />

  half a breath left on my death bed, screaming F that<br />
  yeah super ill, baby what the deal &ndash; we can chill &ndash; split half a pill and a happy meal&hellip;</p>
<p class="style14">She stands in the corner.  She&rsquo;s wearing a t-shirt &ndash; Brigitte Bardot smoking a cigarette on the chest.</p>
<p class="style14">-	Take off your shirt.<br />
  -	Is that what you want?<br />
  -	You&rsquo;re friend left you, huh?</p>
<p class="style14">I&rsquo;m looking about the room.</p>
<p class="style14">-	I don&rsquo;t like it in here.<br />
  -	Why do you not like it in here?<br />
  -	I don&rsquo;t want to tell you.  I think it sounds mysterious if I don&rsquo;t say anything.  I like when people walk out of rooms.  That kind of attitude interests me.<br />
  -	Come here, she says.<br />
  (You don&rsquo;t say?)  This is what I&rsquo;m thinking to myself.</p>
<p class="style14">I&rsquo;m in a bed.  The covers are up to my ankles.  There is a lamp on a chest near the bed.  The lights are on.  Jackson&rsquo;s outside with the shit up his nose.  He&rsquo;s having a hellava time &ndash; all that shit he&rsquo;s got out there &ndash; the loads he&rsquo;s putting right up his nose.  He&rsquo;s the partying kind of fellow.  Never one to turn down a load; not the sort to turn up his nose like he&rsquo;s too fancy.  No, he&rsquo;s certainly got his face right in the stuff.  I know that much about him.</p>
<p class="style14">-	Just lie like that.  I leave her on the bed and back away.  She&rsquo;s lying on her stomach.  I stand up and have a look at the brown, yellow tinted light and dust.  It&rsquo;s a muddy affair.  Put your right hand by your face, I say.  I say: curl your fingers so that they twist under your chin.  Everything&rsquo;s to the left.  She&rsquo;s lying with her head turned to the left.<br />
  -	I look good don&rsquo;t I?<br />
  -	You look great.<br />
  -	Don&rsquo;t spread your legs too much.  And don&rsquo;t cross &lsquo;em either.  She doesn&rsquo;t.  She&rsquo;s listening quietly.  Her body is tired looking; her eyes are still wide-open and big and that motivates me.<br />
  -	Do you want to play with me, she asks?  Do you want to stand there?  Are you having fun directing me?<br />
  -	Give me a minute, I say.  I walk over to the side of the bed.  The left side.  She can see me, and everything I am is close to the light.  The lamp has one of those dimmer knobs on it and I turn it so that the room goes a bit softer.<br />
  -	Look at me.  I bend down and look her in the eyes.  She has the most beautiful eyes.  Her skin is so pale under the lamp.  She says: kiss me.</p>
<p class="style14">Outside in the Alley is where Jackson now sits.  He and the Swede are slapping it around.  By now they&rsquo;re old friends.</p>
<p class="style14">I&rsquo;ve lost my language and I&rsquo;m thinking about picking up a Mediterranean one.  I&rsquo;ll pick up Greek whenever I get out of here.  I&rsquo;ll pick it up on my way out there.  I gotta get on a plane anyhow.</p>

<p class="style2">Jackson said he heard of something happening over there in  Indian Hills.&nbsp; He said it like that: over  there.</p>
<p class="style2">Over there in them hills.</p>
<p class="style2">Jackson said he&rsquo;d heard of a party over in the hills.&nbsp; Naturally, he added, as if he had quickly  adjusted both sleeves of his shirt (this type of adding came easily to him)  there will be scores of women.&nbsp; He wanted  to get going; though, he figured we ought to pick up some food on the way: some  barbeque, he said.</p>
<p class="style2">We drove in a car Jackson had borrowed from a friend.&nbsp; It was a wobbly car.&nbsp; Two of the tires were low, and the alignment  was off &ndash; the wheel wanted to veer to the right.&nbsp; This was a perfect kind of drive for it &ndash; we  were the two perfect companions.<br />
  Jackson had a few friends in town,  and he used each of them heavily.&nbsp; We  made a stop at Mark&rsquo;s, for the food.&nbsp; We  ate at a normal speed, and afterward we cleaned ourselves up.&nbsp; Back in the car Jackson said:<br />
  - Lets turn around, we ought to go  sit somewhere &ndash; get a cup of coffee downtown.&nbsp;  That&rsquo;s what we ought to be doing.<br />
  - Where the hell do you get off?</p>
<p class="style2">I wasn&rsquo;t so angry.</p>
<p class="style2">Jackson tried to steer the car correctly.&nbsp; It looked quite hard to do.&nbsp; I thought he was decidedly overmatched.&nbsp; We had as good a shot ending up in a ditch  than any other place.<br />
  - I don&rsquo;t really know anyone out  there.&nbsp; I only just heard&rsquo;v it.&nbsp; Do you think you&rsquo;ll know anyone?<br />
  - In Indian Hills?&nbsp; You know very well I don&rsquo;t know a damn  person.<br />
  - I know a couple.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re lousy.&nbsp; Do you want to see a group of lousy drunks?<br />
  - I don&rsquo;t want to see anyone.<br />
  - So that&rsquo;s that.&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;ll turn it around &ndash; get some coffee  like I said.<br />
  - O&rsquo; all right &ndash;<br />
  The party started to interest  me.&nbsp; I conceded to it.&nbsp; Jackson spun the wheel about, correcting his  line, and sometimes overcorrecting, and we wobbled toward the hills.</p>
<p class="style2">Outside the house Jackson said:<br />
  - Everyone says we&rsquo;ll get laid  here.&nbsp; I did not respond.&nbsp; I could have.<br />
  The house was new looking &ndash;  refurbished.&nbsp; It was made of wood; it was  a standard American home.<br />
  - You&rsquo;re from California, Jackson  said; he stated it really.&nbsp; I was trying  to close the car door, and having a tough go of it.&nbsp; The handle was stuck.&nbsp; Jackson kicked the door, hitting it squarely  with his heel.&nbsp; It flew into the body and  slammed shut: you&rsquo;re from California, he said.&nbsp;  The girls here will be happy to meet you.<br />
  - So then what&rsquo;s your angle?<br />
  - Well I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in  Europe.&nbsp; We stood there like that, in  front of the standard looking house, talking about geography.</p>
<p class="style2">Some bouncing notes jumped out through the front door.&nbsp; The door had been opened; the notes had  escaped.&nbsp; A very large guy stepped out on  to the stoop.&nbsp; He closed the door behind  him, and the notes stopped.&nbsp; He was more  wide than tall, but he was built well, and brawny looking.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It&rsquo;s a  bit funny you getting by with those tales of Europe, I said.&nbsp; It is like a trick, isn&rsquo;t it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I guess  so.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think of it that way.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - How do  you think it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson  didn&rsquo;t answer.&nbsp; He could have.</p>
<p class="style2">Over there behind them Hills.<br />
  Over there&hellip;</p>
<p class="style2">The next morning I asked Jackson if he wanted to see the  latest Rondo film.&nbsp; It was a  documentary.&nbsp; I had grabbed a flyer at a  coffee shop.&nbsp; I rustled my pants and  pulled the flyer out of the back left pocket.&nbsp;  We were staying with another of Jackson&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; I had slept on the couch.&nbsp; My clothes were hanging on the arm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It&rsquo;s  about dinosaurs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -  Literally.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Well,  non.&nbsp; Pas vraiment.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><img src="images/Tokyo.jpg" width="404" height="404" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Chris Isaak&rsquo;s, <em>Wicked Game</em>, played on the wall in the  Shinjuku train station.&nbsp; Jackson asked  what I though of Helena Christensen.<br />
  - I like her, I said.<br />
  - I heard she&rsquo;s republican.<br />
  - Well what about Ford?<br />
  - Yeah, but he wasn&rsquo;t elected.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggested  we head in to the Kagurazaka district.&nbsp;  Sounds fine, Jackson said, I don&rsquo;t care where we eat.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On our way  out of the station we brushed through a line of brochure handlers.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like street promoters because they&rsquo;re  aggressive and rude.&nbsp; I put my hand up  and kept my head down.&nbsp; Jackson smiled,  and grabbed a few.<br />
We decided to take lunch at a small  caf&eacute; on the outside.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t want to  get caught in the middle.&nbsp; In the middle  were the shops and expensive eateries.&nbsp;  The French had carved out a small section in the area near the Lyc&eacute;e  franco-japonais, and they were outfitting it with fusion restaurants.<br />
Jackson and I talked about Tokyo  while we ate.&nbsp; He spread-out the ten or so  brochures he&rsquo;d grabbed from the rail station on the table.&nbsp; I told him I didn&rsquo;t like that.&nbsp; Why the hell-do-ya have to lay &lsquo;em out like  that, I said?<br />
After lunch we went for a  walk.&nbsp; We were not far from the Theatre  Shinjuku, and we had time to spare, so we had a look at the old geisha houses.<br />
- How much you think it costs,  Jackson asked, as we came up on an older looking one?&nbsp; We were standing at the front, in the street;  groups of tourists had been walking up to take a picture of the building.&nbsp; Some were posing in front of it.<br />
- I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I think there&rsquo;s a system to it.&nbsp; Jackson was standing flat-footed in the  street, eying the tourists.<br />
- Well of course there is.&nbsp; I thought it was nice to be outside; the sun  was high and bright.&nbsp; What if I just  wanna fuck one of &lsquo;em?<br />
  - What does it say in the brochure?<br />
  - It says you need to talk with  someone who&rsquo;s heard of the system.<br />
  - Okay.&nbsp; How about it then?<br />
  - O&rsquo; forget it.</p>
<p class="style2">We took our seats in the Theatre  Shinjuku &ndash; room # 2.&nbsp; It was dark, and  the opening credits had already begun rolling.<br />
  Yuta Tabuse wrote, <em>Fried Fish</em>, for  his father, having written it soon after his death.&nbsp; Tabuse had dedicated the film to him.&nbsp; The film was a comedy &ndash; a dark one, and in  the beginning it was clear Tabuse meant to fulfill convention, rather than  deviate from it.<br />
  In an interview from earlier in the  year, Tabuse talked of his father&rsquo;s relationship with the American cinema, and  the post WW2 films of the industrial machine.&nbsp;  He had liked the heaviness, and sturdiness of it.&nbsp; Tabuse thought he would bring that back, the  lumbering weight of the camera, and its directional purpose.&nbsp; Sturges was favored &ndash; with Ken Watanabe  playing the part of Rex Harrison, and Kyoko Fukada playing Linda Darnell.<br />
  In ninety minutes the theater  lights turned back on.&nbsp; I have never  liked the walk outside after sitting in the theater.&nbsp; I tell Jackson I need to jump in the restroom  before we leave.<br />
  Back on the street, Jackson  proposes that we each buy a new pair of jeans.&nbsp;  He says there&rsquo;s a good exchange rate, and we could get a nice deal at  the designer shop on the corner.&nbsp; We walk  down the street, into the last few hours of sunlight.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t dig back into it; we left it the  same as the others had left those films before us, and we jovially bought our  jeans.</p>

<p align="left"><img src="images/The-Majestic-.jpg" width="400" height="246" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">There are 14 rows inside the premi&egrave;re room of the Majestic Theater.&nbsp; The screen is large, off-white; a couple is seated in row six, and another in row five.&nbsp; The first couple, the one in row five, is seated four seats in from the left.&nbsp; The couple in row five is two seats in.&nbsp; I am sitting in the 14th row; I&rsquo;ve counted the rows in front of me because I came early and the premi&egrave;re room is airy and cool.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had had a hard time finding the theater.&nbsp; In between the north and south lanes of the Boulevard Richard Lenoir is the March&eacute; Bastille.&nbsp; On the northbound lane near the Place is the theater.&nbsp; Next to the Majestic, on its left, is a McDonald&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There are too many trees and not enough lights around the March&eacute;.&nbsp; It always surprises me to see McDonald&rsquo;s' next to a theater; however, though it is a surprise to me, it doesn&rsquo;t look to be discouraging the growing appetite.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of burger eaters, all very pleased with one another, snack loudly outside on the Boulevard.&nbsp; Jackson likes that sort of thing.&nbsp; He likes groups.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe in groups.&nbsp; Groups can take the atmosphere away, and I weight that type of thing when I&rsquo;m being critical.&nbsp; And this is the reason I&rsquo;d had a hard time finding the Majestic; I didn&rsquo;t know there would be so many damn burger eaters.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo; forget it, Jackson tells me.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter to Jackson.&nbsp; What truly matters to Jackson is anyone&rsquo;s guess.&nbsp; Anyway, we&rsquo;re early, he says.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Majestic was remodeled in the 90&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the 80&rsquo;s it was called Le Palais, and they played adult films.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sitting alone because Jackson went over to the McDonald&rsquo;s for one of those new wraps &ndash; the one with the chicken tucked inside of a tortilla.&nbsp; Jackson always jumps on the promotional stuff right away.&nbsp; He and I were in Susanville a while back and he ordered a fruit and yogurt parfait just to be unusual.&nbsp; Promotional stuff, I told him, but that&rsquo;s the way it goes.&nbsp; I thought about asking Jackson if he&rsquo;d share a popcorn with me, but I didn&rsquo;t ask.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t want any popcorn and I knew he didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t trust the popcorn at these theaters: Jackson has said that before.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The popcorn in the Majestic looks pretty lousy.&nbsp; In passing, I made sure to glance across the lobby at the bags of popcorn sitting on a rack.&nbsp; The bags sat next to the popper, their corners pressed and sharp.&nbsp; Nothing about them was very thrilling.&nbsp; The bright yellow corn bubbled out of each bag; there couldn&rsquo;t be anything real to it.&nbsp; I like white popcorn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I settle into my seat the lights dim and a few more people walk in.&nbsp; No one makes a rush of it.&nbsp; I never see anyone rush through the door of an art movie.&nbsp; Everyone likes to make a point of being casual.&nbsp; A younger couple takes a seat in row 8; another finds seats in the 10th row.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s the thing with Paris, and with everything else too &ndash; too many couples.&nbsp; I wish there were a stag theater in the 4th.&nbsp; Jackson cracks the door open at the last minute.&nbsp; He slips in and before the light from the lobby can streak the screen he pushes back the door.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I let Jackson know I&rsquo;m bothered by something and he wants to know by what.&nbsp; The people, I tell him, the people are all so fucked up.&nbsp; He tells me to calm down; he tells me this in his little voice.&nbsp; Jackson hopes his little voice comes out condescending enough.&nbsp; He knows there&rsquo;s little I can say about it in the theater.&nbsp; So I tuck my hands between the back of my legs and the soft cushion of the seat, and I take a good look at the large screen.</p>
<p class="style2">Ronny Turiaf&rsquo;s, Le Chemise Noir, his examination of modern day parentless youth, hits the back of the throat directly.&nbsp; From guns, such as the nine-millimeter Glock, the film's main character, Marcus, carries with him each day to grade school, to Marseille&rsquo;s rotting industrial neighborhood La Capelette, to violent lessons in respect and force, to power struggles and the desire for sexual dominance, Turiaf&rsquo;s film covers what we already know about street adolescence and hoodlum behavior.&nbsp; It covers what we already expect from impoverished dwellings, as well as what we assume are the teenage results of fatherless children.&nbsp; The film, unlike the others of its kind, means only to go over it all again &ndash; like another year of Shakespeare in the park &ndash; like a remake of The French Connection, or Bullitt &ndash; hoping you haven&rsquo;t forgotten that some cops don&rsquo;t come only with a badge, but with guts too.&nbsp; Turiaf covers what most of us have already seen, and while doing so he reminds us that life is fierce, life is wild, and life is fleeting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson and I take a drink after the film ends and talk about it.&nbsp; We convince each other that our discussion will continue long after the drinks, but it doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sharp film, Jackson says, there&rsquo;s either too much edge, or not enough.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know which, he says, but it&rsquo;s one or the other.&nbsp; So then you didn&rsquo;t like it, I said.&nbsp; Jackson admits faintly that he wanted to, but that it was just too damn edgy.&nbsp; I liked it, I said.&nbsp; Too bad you didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I liked it flat out, I said.&nbsp; Turiaf isn&rsquo;t a reinventionist, he&rsquo;s a colorist &ndash; I figured this was the best thing I could say about him.&nbsp; I said it with authority, and Jackson didn&rsquo;t realize that reinventionist isn&rsquo;t even a word in the dictionary.&nbsp; I supposed he thought the word should be, and so he allowed it to pass.&nbsp; In fact, I said, I think he ought to be nominated for something.&nbsp; He ought to be damn nominated.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t nominate him for a thing, Jackson said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No they won&rsquo;t.<br />
