  <p align="center" class="style2">Nothing Is Boring. <br />
    Kelly and Becky are  bored.<br />
    They could do a number of things because they are on winter break.<br />
    But in all honesty, Kelly has two kids and nothing is changing for her. Money is tighter than ever. She'd rather be at work getting paid since her vacation is not covered by her employer. <br />
    Becky is out of school for the moment. Doesn't know if she wants to go back in three weeks. She heads over to Kelly's house to watch tv but nothing is on, not even <em>Fag Tag</em>. She thought the kids running around  with their new toys would be exciting, but no, it's boring too. She wants to go for a long drive, but her Dad took away the car.<br />
    Kelly and Becky should put their boredom aside and make an album that changes the game. They could call it &quot;Shut Up Swag, Boring Times Get Me Off&quot; and make billions of dollars that they can give away to all the bored people of the world.<br />
    They really hate rap music.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">Elgin Baylor was named after his father's watch. Four decades later, Elgin Baylor Lumpkin, who went on to become the raunchy, space-age R&amp;B vocalist Ginuwine, was named after him. Baylor, the 6'5&quot;, 225-pound forward who spent his entire career with the Lakers, is basketball's stylistic bridge between gentlemanly timekeeping and stuttering syncopation. He's generally credited with breaking the game's vertical plane.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">On January 12, Mr. M&eacute;zot, a painter of artistic scenes, dreams that two young people from the firm of Mariage Brothers, makers of fine teas, are taking him somewhere in a taxicab. He feels like a prisoner; when the cab stops on the quai de l'Horloge, he opens the door and leaps out. He rushes towards a poor madman, who is in the process of hanging himself from a lamppost. &quot;Give me that rope!&quot; shouts Mr. M&eacute;zot. The madman gives it to him. Mr. M&eacute;zot knots the rope around his ankles. &quot;This is how you tie yourself up,&quot; he explains, in order to save the stranger.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">In the second part of the dream, it's the Mariage Brothers themselves who congratulate Mr. M&eacute;zot warmly. &quot;A son-in-law who makes tea is a born ally,&quot; one of them says, citing a Turkish proverb. Well, yes, that's right, Mr. M&eacute;zot says to himself just before he wakes up, seeing, perhaps, this poor sick person attached to a lamppost as a kind of human teabag. That morning, Mr. M&eacute;zot will have time only to reflect that he didn't make tea at all; rather the opposite. Soon he will be obliged to think of other things: it's his wedding day.</p>

    I knew you'd make it one day. Big house. Big SUV. Comfy corner office. You went from rapper to dapper. And you never sucked a tranny's dick like Fatlip. Much props on that. But what I'm really contacting you about is to see if you still have any weed connections. Remember that guy, Fred, you used to deal with back in '97? You gave me his number (I think it was his pager) and he called me back and invited me over to his &quot;studio.&quot; When I walked in I really didn't expect Fred and his boys to jump me, but honestly, they were kinda nice about it (no raised voices, no weapons, etc.). I didn't have that much cash on me, and unbeknownest to him I grabbed a baggy with a few grams off the floor before I ran out. Anyways, don't give me his number again. Give me the number of someone you really trust. Maybe someone from your office. A professional with a side hustle. If you don't remember me from that time we hung out in Bolinas or if you don't have any connects, just go ahead and delete this email.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">I was white. I had married a white woman. I had a white child. My mother's father had worked as a longshoreman in Saint Louis. A dockworker as black as coal. All my life I'd hated whites. I'd hid and fled from them. I might have resembled them, but back then I also feared them. And now, I can't even understand why I felt what I felt, because I no longer look at the world through the eyes of a Black man. I had been unaware of the slow evolution that had taken place, and now tonight, I found myself changed, transformed, assimilated.</p>

I think they'll call it second-degree and that makes it five years or seven or ten or maybe more, depending on the emotional condition or the stomach condition of the people on the parole board.
