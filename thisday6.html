  <p align="center" class="style2">THE MOSCOW RULES</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">Assume nothing.<br />
    Murphy is right.<br />
    Never go against your gut.<br />
    Everyone is potentially under opposition control.<br />
    Don't look back, you are never completely alone.<br />
    Go with the flow. Use the terrain.<br />
    Establish a distinctive and dynamic profile and pattern.<br />
    Stay consistent over time.<br />
    Let them believe they lost you.<br />
    Act innocent.<br />
    Lull them into a sense of complacency.<br />
    There is no limit to a human being's ability to rationalize the truth.<br />
    Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, three times is an enemy action.<br />
    Use misdirection, illusion and deception.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2"><strong>16. MY ONE TRUE LOVE</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">On the wall someone has written my one true love. She put the cigarette between her lips and waited for the man to light it for her. She had a shiny, olive-complexion and mahogany-colored hair. Someone opened the back door of the car and she got in silently. They glided along the deserted streets of a residential neighborhood. It was the time of the year when most of the houses were empty. The man parked on a narrow street of single-story houses with identical yards. She went into the bathroom and he made coffee. The kitchen had brown tiles patterned with arabesques, and looked like a gym. She opened the curtains, there were no lights in any of the houses across the street. She took off her satin dress and the man lit another cigarette for her. Before she pulled down her underpants, the man arranged her on all fours on the soft white rug. She heard him look for something in the wardrobe. A wardrobe built into the wall, a red wardrobe. She watched him upside down, through her legs. The man smiled at her. Now someone is walking down a street where cars are parked only next to their respective lairs. Above the street, like a hanged man, swings the spot-lit sign of the neighborhood's best restaurant, closed a long time ago. Footsteps vanish down the street, headlights are visible in the distance. She said no. She listens. There's someone outside. The man went over to the window, then came back naked toward the bed. She was tan, minus where her underpants usually reside, and sometimes she pretended to be asleep. He looked at her from the door with a detached sweetness. There are silences made just for us. He pressed his face against hers until it hurt and pushed himself into her with a single thrust. Maybe she screamed a little. From the street however, nothing could be heard. They fell asleep without moving apart.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">Israel attacks Syrian positions in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. Numerous air defense installations are destroyed and 23 Syrian aircraft shot by the IAF, while Israeli armored units drive the Syrian army back as far as Lake Karaoun. Given that Syria has made no offensive gesture towards Israel, the Israeli assault upon Syrian millitary forces compounds Israel's violation of the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concenring Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance With the Charter of the United Nations and UNGA Res. 337A (V).</p>

  <p align="center" class="style2">Let's make it  another day's afternoon.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">6.11.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Ginuwine sat around the studio for some time this afternoon. He said to check for his new album, that he had a feeling about this one. He said it doesn't matter how he sings live, they only come to watch him dance now. I told him he should eat one of the cupcakes left over from the morning and he did. He didn't seem like the kind of guy who would ever tell a lie. I got in my car and drove home singing, still wondering.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">Gerard met with Mac Mall and Ice-T in the rear of Formosa Cafe to discuss the possibility of them acting as lovers in a movie he wrote titled,<em>The Loud Sound of Rape Whistles</em>. <br />
    Gerard said he'd love for Ice-T's wife, Cocco, to get involved in the project. Ice-T kept checking his watch and tapping his fingers on the table. He wrote on a napkin: Do I look like a cracker?<br />
    Mac Mall said he'd commit if he could use a stand in for any kissing or sex scenes. Gerard said he wouldn't compromise. He wanted it all natural. He said: Just get comfortable with each other. Let loose. <br />
    So Mac leaned over to kiss Ice and the scene
    turned dirty like Sunset &amp; Fairfax. Ice took Gerard's napkin and wrote: You crackers never learn.</p>

  <p align="left">Victor Mature was  born in Louisville, where he started a candy business before moving to California.  The shop was still selling sugar to Slugger Museum visitors when P was in high  school. He cared for the shop as if it were a family business, which was fitting  because Mature treated the boy like a son.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">It was an old haunt she hadn't entered for over 8 years, and it was definitely not daytime the last time she was there. Never before 11 she would say to her girlfriends.<br />
    The early afternoon sun spilled in through the thick blinds, casting a noirish tint to the red booths and bar stools. She needed to make a call and figured she could do so in private here since the only accompaniment was fragmented sunshine and a 'busy cleaning the lines' bartender (she used to be friendly with every bartender in the place, this one she had never seen, she didn't feel like asking if Charlie, Chuck, or Yves was still around).<br />
    She made her call from a rotary phone the bartender provided from under the oak, horseshoe-shaped bar. Payphone is broken, he said as he sat the phone on the counter. Thanks, she said. The bartender pushed through a swinging door and disappeared. She dialed the number, stared at an almost empty bottle of J.T.S. Brown and thought of Paul for perhaps only the second or third time since they filmed that movie together, a few doors down, at the billiards hall.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">The sun was going down as we left Malibu and headed north on 101, running smoothly through Oxnard and along the ocean to Santa Barbara. My companion was a little nervous about my speed, so I gave her some gin to calm her down. Soon she relaxed against me, and I put my arm around her. Rosanne Cash was on the radio, singing about the seven-year ache, and the traffic was opening up.</p>

  <p align="left">Iba caminando,  sudado y con el pelo pegado<br />
    en la cara<br />
    cuando vi a Ernesto Cardenal que ven&iacute;a<br />
    en direcci&oacute;n contraria<br />
    y a modo de saludo le dije:<br />
    Padre, en el Reino de los Cielos<br />
    que es el comunismo,<br />
  &iquest;tienen un  sitio los homosexuales?<br />
    S&iacute;, dijo &eacute;l.<br />
  &iquest;Los esclavos del sexo?<br />
  &iquest;Los bromistas del sexo?<br />
  &iquest;Los sadomasoquistas, las putas, los fan&aacute;ticos<br />
    de los enemas, <br />
    los que ya no pueden m&aacute;s, los que de verdad<br />
    ya no pueden m&aacute;s?<br />
    Y Cardenal dijo s&iacute;.<br />
    Y yo levant&eacute; la vista<br />
    y las nubes parec&iacute;an<br />
    sonrisas de gatos levemente rosadas<br />
    y los &aacute;rboles que pespunteaban la colina<br />
    (la colina que hemos de subir)<br />
    agitaban las ramas.<br />
    Los &aacute;rboles salvajes, como diciendo<br />
    alg&uacute;n d&iacute;a, m&aacute;s temprano que tarde, has de venir<br />
    a mis brazos gomosos, a mis brazos sarmentosos,<br />
    a mis brazos fr&iacute;os. Una frialdad vegetal <br />
  que te erizar&aacute; los pelos. </p>
