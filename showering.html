  <p align="center" class="style6">SHOWERING</p>
  <p align="left" class="style5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gentleman should always present his best self.&nbsp; If his best self is unavailable, at least a pleasant smelling self.&nbsp; Scent, as many readers already know, is closely tied to taste and taste, being related to food, is our most primal sense.&nbsp; Oh, how we recline and exclaim with joy when a succulent morsel of food is tossed around by our tongue, its fats and salts coating our eager taste buds.&nbsp; I submit to you, dear reader, that scent can give the same pleasure, if not an even more intense one.&nbsp; How often have you felt a flood of emotions after smelling the first rain of spring?&nbsp; Or that feeling conjured up by a whiff of a young lady&rsquo;s sweat-dampened neck?&nbsp; Your scent should be the thing that she keeps coming back for.&nbsp; When you embrace, her inhalations, deep and slow, signal that she desires you not for your fancy car or prestigious social position, of which you no doubt are in possession, but that thing which cannot be bought or traded for; a pleasing natural scent.&nbsp; <br />
    <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I should backtrack slightly and say that the suggestions I am about to layout do involve purchasing certain products.&nbsp; These are meant to be only examples and not endorsements of particular goods (unless the wise and noble marketing professionals at Colgate-Palmolive deem my recommendations to have some monetary value).<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleanliness is a man&rsquo;s first duty as a gentleman.&nbsp; If he is not clean, he can hope to attain exactly none of the things he seeks.&nbsp; A gentleman should never take a bath; baths are for ladies.&nbsp; There are certain exceptions to this rule, which I will outline in subsequent sections.&nbsp; As I stated before, a man should aim to maintain a pleasing personal scent.&nbsp; But how does one go about cultivating a captivating aroma?&nbsp; This can only be accomplished with trial and error and a bit of luck.&nbsp; A gentleman should have a few basic items at the ready for cleaning his body; shampoo and conditioner, soap, deodorant and a shaving kit.&nbsp; Cologne is unnecessary.&nbsp; It signals that you are trying to cover up something, when what you want to do is display your natural smell.&nbsp; You may ask, &ldquo;but cologne and perfume have been around for centuries!&nbsp; Why, if it was good enough for French nobility is it not good enough for me?&rdquo;&nbsp; To that I would simply say, look at the French nobility today.&nbsp; I think you have your answer.<br />
    <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily showers are not necessary.&nbsp; Certainly, if one engages in vigorous activity that causes an excessive amount of sweating, then by all means a gentleman should wash.&nbsp; In most instances a shower every other day will suffice.&nbsp; After you shower, once you have dried yourself, apply a liberal amount of deodorant to the underarms.&nbsp; Choosing a deodorant should be done with care, as there are many varieties that can complement the natural odors you produce from normal daily sweating.&nbsp; As a teenager taking my first steps into puberty, I tried different brands and types of deodorants with varying success.&nbsp; Gels were too runny, solid whites too cakey, until I settled on Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport scent.&nbsp; The deodorant itself has a pleasing enough aroma, but something happens when I apply it and go about my day that enhances both the deodorant&rsquo;s scent and my own organic scent that makes the female nose perk up.&nbsp; Many times I have been asked if I am wearing cologne, to which I reply with an earnest, no, it must be my deodorant.&nbsp; In fact, a female friend of mine in high school was so taken with my scent that she used to literally stick her face in my armpit and inhale deeply of my sweet perspirings.&nbsp; She would even ask me, &ldquo;Can I smell your deodorant?&rdquo; to which I naturally obliged.&nbsp; <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not claim that this deodorant or any other for that matter will miraculously increase your popularity with women, as some dubious late-night TV ads claim of their products*.&nbsp; But if you are smelling your best, you signal to a potential encounter that you care about your appearance and how you present yourself and that is one of the true marks of a gentleman.<br />
    <br />
    *Human pheromone research is highly inconclusive and any claim that a small vial of purple liquid will send women (or men) swooning and salivating is completely overblown and should be treated as utterly false.&nbsp; </p>
