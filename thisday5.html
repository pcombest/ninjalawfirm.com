  <p align="left" class="style2">Kenneth remembers the time that Kelis came into his office to discuss divorce proceedings from Nasir Jones. She hung her Fendi bag on the hatrack by the door, walked over to the cartouche-designed black sofa, sat down and started to laugh and laugh and laugh.<br />
    Kenneth went through the routine questions and paperwork as normal, but in the back of his mind, unspoken to Kelis, the music and lyrics of <em>Illmatic</em> were playing over and over and over. 
    Inside, Kenneth was laughing too. Then he asked Kelis if he could buy her a drink at Chez Jeannette. She declined.</p>

    He played a game of snooker and smoked cigarettes as his body began to warm.<br />
  <br />
    Before leaving the bar, he said to his friend, <br />
    Bombs again. Just now. <br />

    His body exploded, a magnificent explosion, that night near Siam Square. <br />

      <br />
    Sometimes emotions get in the way and we end up with miscues, which can get ugly. If the emotions, like love, regret and contempt, go unavoided and flare, then it's simple, we abort the mission. <br />
  <br />
    We require straightface and steady hands.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">In 1972 a close friend of mine ran into trouble with the law. She was in Thailand that year, living in a small village not far from the town of Lampang. As it happened, I was visiting on the day a plainclothes detective drove up to her cottage and presented her with a summons to appear in court. The charges were serious enough to require a lawyer. My friend asked around and was given a name, and the next morning we bicycled into town to meet with this person and discuss the case. To my astonishment, he worked for a firm called Argue &amp; Phibbs.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">The barges I chartered at Pisa never arrived. I think I have been gulled; and it's the same with everything. I curse a thousand times the day and the hour I left Carrara! That's the reason for my ruin. But I shall soon return there. It's commiting a sin today to succeed.
