<p align="left" class="style16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="style10">&nbsp;</span>Egon Schiele should logically have become a locomotive engineer, or a brakeman, or a petty official in the railroad office of some little Austrian town. For two generations before his birth, railroads had provided the occupations of the Schiele family. It was a source of pride that paternal grandfather, Ludwig Schiele, had directed the construction and been the first general inspector of the impressively named Imperial Royal Privileged West Railway of Bohemia (present-day Czechoslokakia). Egon's father, Adolf Schiele, did not rise to such prominence, but he too was a railroad man and stationmaster of the small town Tulln, about forty miles west of Vienna. Egon Schiele was born in Tulln and, as the only son in the family, was expected to continue the tradition and aspire to be at least an engine driver. He was thus born into a family that was quite unprepared, by background or by custom, to understand the precocious manifestations of his artistic gift.</p>

<p align="left" class="style2">The eyes belonging to Dorothy West strained to the corners of her eyelids as she searched the peripheral for someone to wipe the mess of yogurt from her chin and chest. She grunted and let out a soft, long moan like a dying wolf. Donna ran into the sitting room with a cool, damp washcloth. Mariah Carey's &quot;Someday&quot; was blaring from the radio. Donna moved her hips and lips to the music as she wiped away the yogurt. She said to herself, this is a good job. I like this job.</p>
<p align="left" class="style2">A few days later, I told Donna to shut the fuck up at the Dairy Queen over by Shelia's. She tried to shove an ice cream cake in my lap, but I slid out of the booth and it landed on the seat. We could have put it back in the package and left to argue in the car, but instead, we moved to another booth and watched the cake melt.</p>
<p align="left" class="style2">A Dairy Queen employee refilling napkin containers saw the melted cream all over the bench and floor and ran to get a bucket and mop. I made it appear I had slipped and fallen on the ice cream. The employee returned. Donna called the cops.</p>
<p align="left" class="style2">Two cops came into the Dairy Queen and said to quit fucking around or they would  book us for drunk and disorderly conduct.</p>

<p align="left" class="style19">I was always fishing for something on the radio. Just like trains and bells, it was the soundtrack of my life. I moved the dial up and down and Roy Orbison's voice came blasting out of the small speakers. His new song, &quot;Running Scared,&quot; exploded into the room.<br />
  Orbison transcended all the genres---folk, country, rock and roll or just about anything. His stuff mixed all the styles and some that hadn't even been invented yet. He could sound mean and nasty on one line and then sing in a falsetto voice like Frankie Valli in the next. With Roy you didn't know if you were listening to mariachi or opera. He kept you on your toes.<br />
  His vocie could jar a corpse, always leave you muttering to yourself something like, &quot;Man, I don't believe it.&quot; His songs had songs within songs. They shifted from major to minor key without any logic. Orbison was deadly serious---no pollywog and no fledging juvenile. There wasn't anything else on the radio like him. I'd listen and wait for another song, but next to Roy the playlist was strictly dullsville...gutless and flabby. It all came at you like you didn't have a brain.</p>

<p align="left" class="style2">Although they both worked an average of fifteen hours a day, they still found the time to have a few drinks at night, by the light of a butane lamp, sitting on plastic chairs by the front door of their tent, brushing away the mosquitoes and chatting about this and that. Mainly about how filthy human beings are. Their nightly debriefings always came around to shit, in its various forms, as if it was a language they were struggling to decipher. Talking with them I learned that people shat in the showers, on the floors, on either side of the toilet bowl, and even on its edge, which is no mean feat, requiring a considerable degree of balance and skill. People used to shit to write on the doors and to foul the hand basins. Shit that had to be shat and then shifted to symbolic and prominent places: the mirror, the fire extinguisher, the faucets. Shit gathered and daubed to make animal forms (giraffes, elephants, Mickey Mouse), or the letters of soccer graffiti, or bodily organs (eyes, hearts, dicks).</p>
