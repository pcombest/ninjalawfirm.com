<p align="center" class="style1">This day in rap history...</p>
<p align="center" class="style5">2.1.10</p>
<p align="left" class="style2">Ragtime was a household favorite. Most parents forbade the noise pouring out from the red-light district, but Lily's found it catchy. Her father would swing her around by the feet as the sounds of Jelly Roll Morton blared out of the family phonograph. Her mom always sat in the rocking chair and said, &quot;You two should be in the pictures.&quot;<br />
  Dad preferred Al Jolson to anything. He once smeared shoe polish all over his face and performed <em>Mammy</em> at the town's annual picnic. Lily was embarrassed, so she walked back home, went  straight to her room and read until she fell asleep. When she awoke the next morning her book was creased and her father still had polish behind his ears. </p>
<p align="center" class="style5">2.2.10</p>
<p align="left" class="style2">Edgar Martinez was one of Jay&rsquo;s favorite baseball cards. He had the Fleer &rsquo;88 rookie card and he wrote &ldquo;butterball&rdquo; with a felt tip pen over Edgar Martinez&rsquo;s name. He didn&rsquo;t really think Edgar was fat. He actually loved Edgar on the diamond. When his Dad found the card in Jay&rsquo;s album he asked what the fuck he thought he was doing and told him that the card would have been worth money.</p>

<p align="left" class="style2">Peters' favorite hip-hop duo, he decided when he was 17, is The Beatnuts. <br />
    <br />
  The day before his 21st birthday, Peters found himself listening to a message left by Psycho Les &amp; Juju as he walked through the mall arguing with his girl, Michelle... <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Voicemail</strong>: <em>Yo P! It's  Les and Ju. &iexcl;Hemos o&iacute;do que es su cumplea&ntilde;os ma&ntilde;ana! Dirty Boots. We're taking over!</em><br />
  <br />
  <strong>Michelle</strong>: <em>Hang that shit up! </em><br />
  <strong>Peters</strong>: <em>You hang it up. This mall's noisy. I can't hear shit!</em><br />
  <strong>Michelle</strong>: <em>I'm calling my sister to pick me up.</em><br />
  <strong>Peters</strong>: <em>Not on my phone. I got  messages to listen to.<br />
  </em><strong>Michelle</strong>: <em>We're not doing nothin' for your birthday tomorrow.<br />
  </em><br />
  That next day, Michelle stayed at her sister's house and watched re-runs of <em>Plaid Style Day Catcher </em>(Peters'  least liked show), while The Beatnuts came through Peters' house in East Rutherford for an impromptu house party. Peters was in awe, due mainly to the sheer amount of children and ballons they brought. </p>

<p align="left" class="style2">Police radios were buzzing and fuzzing as they took Sean Paul off the stage for irreverent dance moves while performing amidst 7,000 college students and a streak of spring humidity in Huntsville, Alabama. The weather report that morning said temperatures could reach fire.<br />
  Sean was wearing a velour jumpsuit when he was introduced, but before being apprehended, only a black wife-beater with white briefs. <br />
  Sweat was all over the stage. <br />
  Two freshmen, Tanya and Grace, and a sophomore, Sheldon, took turns having a dance-off to appease the dehydrated crowd. 
  The students wet their whistle enough to yell a chant of, &quot;LICK - IT. LICK - IT. LICK - IT.&quot; referring to the sweat collected beneath their feet and on their bodies. </p>

<p align="center" class="style2">MOVIES I SNUCK INTO AS A KID </p>
<p align="left" class="style2">Karate and horror films. Once me and my crew snuck into a triple feature with <em>Old Yeller</em> on the bill and we all puked. Basically we'd go into a movie to talk to girls and steal purses. I didn't sit in the movies to absorb film. I still have some of the worst taste in America as far as films go.</p>

<p align="left" class="style2">We walked across the pavement of an unkempt basketball court around the way. I tried to hold her hand but she bent down to pick up a piece of trash. The litter turned out to be a gold charm that said SHORTY in diamond-studded cursive. I told her she should get the jump ring fixed and wear it. She said it wasn&rsquo;t her style and dropped it back onto the cracked cement. I took a picture of both the broken charm and her walking away. On the other side of the fence surrounding the court someone yelled through the cutting wind, &ldquo;Yo! Take that yokie&rsquo;s camera!&rdquo; I picked up the gold word and threw it at the chain-links. </p>

<p align="center" class="style2">Nothing happened on this date in the entire history of rap.</p>
<p align="center" class="style5">2.19.10</p>
<p align="left" class="style2">Around 1855 in North Carolina a shoot-out took place between some white settlers and the last band of hostile Indians left hiding out in the mountains. The settlers won, captured the Indian chief and hung him from the nearest tree. His name was Skyuka. The shoot-out was talked up over the years until it got to be known as the Battle of Round Mountain. With the Indians gone, the railroad company began laying a single track into the mountains, and four miles uphill of a little town called Landrum they built a passing station so a train going downhill could pull over and let an uphill one by. Next to the track they built a few houses to shelter the railroad workers during the winter. Then they started thinking about a name for this new town. <br />
  Someone suggested that they call it Skyuka after the lynched Indian chief, but the older folks didn&rsquo;t take to the idea of naming their town after a man they had once set swinging from a tree, so they called it Tyron City instead, after Tyron Peak which towered above them. In 1891 they dropped the city part and settled for plain Tyron, and that&rsquo;s how my home town was born. </p>

  Purvis burned his tongue with coffee as he replied to Al&rsquo;s ad. <br />
  He wrote:<br />
  <br />
  Mr. Kent, <br />
  <br />
  It would be an honor to buy those speakers off of you. If they are in steady working condition and are still available I would like to come pick them up at your earliest convenience.<br />
  <br />
  Thanks,<br />

<p align="left">Kandinsky shot a glare in Klee&rsquo;s direction as he tapped the face of his watch. <br />
  &quot;Let&rsquo;s get a move on.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Gee Vassily, vat&rsquo;s the rush?&quot;<br />
  They had just seated themselves at a caf&eacute; in Neuilly-sur-Seine, alongside, but not with, thirteen noisy, armed Germans. <br />
  The one garson was speaking with a regular at the bar and had yet to acknowledge their presence, much less make his way over. Kandinsky really wasn&rsquo;t feeling it. <br />
  &quot;PAUL! Paul Klee! Heiliger Bimbam!&quot; one of the Germans exclaimed from the overcrowded table. The table fell silent, as all of the German ears perked up and necks stretched like an owl scanning the field for a mouse.<br />
  &quot;Heiliger Bimbam, it&rsquo;s Axel.&quot; Klee whispered into his hand beneath all the attention. He handed Kandinsky a pocket sketchbook and a gold lighter under the tablecloth and stood up.<br />
  The highly excitable German approached the table with medals dangling. <br />
  &quot;Paul! How have you been? It&rsquo;s me, Axel!&quot;<br />
  The German looked as if he was going to hug Klee but Paul quickly extended his hand. The familiarity caused the table of Germans to lose their gaze and return to their general ruckus.<br />
  &quot;Not well.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sorry to hear that.&quot;<br />
  &quot;What brings you to Paris?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Don&rsquo;t you know?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&quot;<br />
  &quot;We came for you.&quot;<br />
  &quot;For me?&quot;<br />
  &quot;The Fuhrer wishes to obtain your services.&quot;<br />
  &quot;He can&rsquo;t have them.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I&rsquo;ll let him know.&quot; Scoffing. &quot;Personally!&quot; The German threw his right arm up in salute and clicked his heels.<br />
  &quot;Do that Axel. You do that.&quot;<br />
  He left Klee standing next to the table where Kandinsky was seated and returned to his cohorts. 
  The owls appeared again.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Swatow tossed her camera into the leather bag that Fran had bought her three months back. <br />
  <br />
  She remembered that brisk October day when they met in Bryant Park for lunch and Fran was nearly 40 minutes late. Swatow passed time looking at the array of people camouflaged by the shades of brown and orange falling to the ground. Two kids were making piles from the leaves. They would dash in front of lackadaisical Midtown-ites and jump into the mound of dead colors. CRUNCH! <br />
  <br />
  Fran arrived carrying a medium-sized bag with a graphic label of a purple branch that was slightly raised over white gloss. <br />
  <br />
  You made it.<br />
  I know, I&rsquo;m sorry, I ran into Sal before I got on the train.<br />
  How&rsquo;s Sal?<br />
  Sal&rsquo;s Sal. He was telling me about the show they played on Friday. Like 20 people showed up.<br />
  Been shopping?<br />
  It&rsquo;s for <em>you</em> actually.<br />
  For me?!<br />
  Yea, I&rsquo;ve been making some extra cash doing promotion for Ron Mercer. <br />
  Ron Mercer?<br />
  He used to play for the Nets or something, now he sells jewelry to QVC.<br />
  And you work for him?<br />
  Yea, but not for the jewelry, he has an art gallery down on Essex.<br />
  Does he sell that on tv too?<br />
  Maybe&hellip;it&rsquo;s pretty bad.<br />
  Like how bad?<br />
  Like worse than that mexicanese exhibit we saw at FLOGO.<br />
  Wow&hellip;that is bad. What do you do?<br />
  Nothing really. He just wants me around to help organize. He gives me like $500 and I&rsquo;m there from 12-3.<br />
  I thought you said you were doing promotion.<br />
  Yea, I send out emails for the gallery&rsquo;s events.<br />
  What are the events?<br />
  I don&rsquo;t know, they haven&rsquo;t had one yet.<br />
  Do they sell anything?<br />
  No. He just hangs out with that old NOLA rapper, Skull Duggery.<br />
  What do they do?<br />
  <em>We</em> usually eat lunch. Sometimes they make me stop at Dean &amp; Deluca to pick up ingredients.<br />
  For what?<br />
  Skull is like this amazing chef.<br />
  Skull cooks? <br />
  He made this amazing Botticelli Clam Linguine.<br />
  Botticelli?<br />
  He names every dish after an artist. De Chirico Ham and Eggs with Grits.<br />
  Has a thing for Italians?<br />
  Who doesn&rsquo;t?<br />
  I have to come visit you!<br />
  Come with me on Thursday.<br />
  Is it a date?<br />
  Yea, lunch date with Skull and Ron.</p>
