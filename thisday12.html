I started mowing my yard when I was 10 and I mowed other people's yards a year later. I made enough money that if my parents divorced I could have supported myself without my father's child support. Pass this along to little Dustin.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">Roy was puzzled by the last words spoken by the dying father to his daughter at the end of the movie <em>The Great Failure</em>: &quot;It is far more difficult to forget than to remember. How much happier I might have been had I sooner understood this simple fact.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Roy was nine years old when he saw <em>The Great Failure</em> at the Uptown theater with Jimmy Boyle. It was part of a double bill with <em>Taza, Son of Cochise</em>, the movie he and Boyle had gone to see, where Rock Hudson plays the Apache chief's kid who joins up with the renegade Geronimo.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Rock must've spent a lot of time lyin' around his swimming pool in Beverly Hills to get that good a roastin',&quot; said Jimmy Boyle.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;They rub grease on his skin to turn it dark,&quot; Roy said. &quot;That way he doesn't get burned.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;He still don't look like an Indian,&quot; said Jimmy. &quot;He looks like an actor with a Hollywood tan. Rocky Graziano looks more like an Indian than Rock Hudson.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Both Boyle and Roy were shivering in the late December wind as they walked home.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;And he don't talk like one, neither,&quot; Jimmy added.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Mrs. Sweeney, the librarian at Clinton, doesn't sound like an Indian either,&quot; said Roy, &quot;and she is an Indian.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Oh yeah? What tribe?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Navajo. She told us she grew up on a reservation in New Mexico.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;No shit. How'd she get to Chicago?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Went to college for Indians in Kansas, then got a job here.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Her skin stay dark even in the winter?&quot; asked Jimmy.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">&quot;She ever talk Navajo?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Roy shook his head. &quot;Not at school. Maybe at home she does.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">That night Roy thought more about what the dying father said at the end of <em>The Great Failure</em>. His daughter in the movie was about the same age as Roy and Roy wondered if she was supposed to have understood what her father meant about it being tougher to forget things than remember them. Roy remembered everything; he could read or see or hear something and it stayed in his brain and when he needed to recall it, or even sometimes when he didn't try to recall it, he could. Roy assumed it would always be this way, which was why he was curious about what the father said about being happy. Things happened and either they were good or bad and depending on what they were a person was happy or sad.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Before he fell asleep, Roy decided that the father thought he was a failure even though he had been a rich lawyer who had become governor of his state and ran for president of the United States. He hadn't failed because he lost the presidential election but because he hadn't spent enough time with his wife and daughter and made them unhappy. His wife had committed suicide by jumping off a bridge into a raging river during a thunderstorm and was swept away and drowned; and his daughter liked to tear the arms and legs off her dolls.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">The family in <em>The Great Failure</em> lived in a mansion in New York and had servants and a big car. Taza, the son of Cochise, lived in a teepee in a desert, rode a buckskin horse bareback and spent most of his time fighting against the U.S. cavalry. Taza was not puzzled but he was not happy, either. Roy was almost always happiest when he was alone. Neither the father nor Taza were ever really alone, so maybe that had something to do with it.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">Let me try to make this clear. The girl above, Tarsila do Amaral, painted this portrait of her lover, Oswald de Andrade. There is little to no doubt that she stroked his face with her own brush.<br />
      <br />
    They carried on an affair for many years and made love in between discussions of art. Sometimes distance divided the two and sometimes they took on new lovers, but nonetheless, they were companions.<br />
  <br />
    It is whispered in small circles that Tarsila was responsible for penning the words to <em>Manifesto Antrop&oacute;fago</em> (<em><a href="http://feastofhateandfear.com/archives/andrade.html" target="_blank">Cannibal Manifesto</a></em>), which was credited to Oswald in 1928, and still is.<br />
  <br />
    The phrases &quot;Screenplays. Screenplays. Screenplays. Screenplays. Screenplays. Screenplays. Screenplays.&quot; and   &quot;Happiness is the real proof.&quot; may be  dead giveaways to his plagarism. </p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Also, she ripped his heart out and ate it. Yet somehow he continued to live...until he was 64. I guess he couldn't stop loving her.</p>
