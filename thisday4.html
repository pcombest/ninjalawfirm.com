  <p align="left" class="style2">This morning [Imelda Marcos] offered the latest in a series of explanations of the billions of dollars that she and her husband, who died in 1989, are believed to have stolen during his presidency.<br />
  &quot;It so coincided that Marcos had money,&quot; she said. &quot;After the Bretton Woods agreement he started buying gold from Fort Knox. Three thousand tons, then 4,000 tons. I have documents for these: 7,000 tons. Marcos was so smart. He had it all. It's funny; America didn't understand him.&quot;</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">All praise to the highways and to these moments. Umbrellas abandoned by bums in shopping plazas with white supermarkets rising at the far ends. It's summer and the policeman are drinking at the back of the bar. Next to the jukebox a girl listens to the latest hits. Around the same time, someone is walking, far from here, away from here, with no plans to come back. A naked boy sitting outside his tent in the woods? The girl stumbled into the bathroom and began to vomit. When you think about it, we're not allotted much time here on Earth to make lives for ourselves: I mean, to scrape something together, get married, wait for death. Her eyes in the mirror like letters fanned out in a dark room; the huddled breathing shape burrowed into bed with her. The men talk about dead small-time crooks, the price of houses on the coast, extra paychecks. One day I'll die of cancer. Cleaning utensils begin to levitate in her head. She says: I could go on and on. The kid came into the room and grabbed her by the shoulders. The two of them wept like characters from different movies projected on the same screen. Red scene of bodies turning on the gas. The bony beautiful hand turned the knob, Choose just one of these phrases: &quot;I escaped torture&quot;...&quot;An unknown hotel&quot;...&quot;No more roads&quot;... </p>

  <p align="center" class="style5">4.23.10</p>
  <p align="left">Sans&oacute;n Fern&aacute;ndez died of AIDS. Prax&iacute;teles Barrionuevo died  in the Hole of Bogot&aacute;. Ernesto San Rom&aacute;n was stabbed to death in the Areanea  sauna in Medell&iacute;n. Alvarito Fuentes died of AIDS in the Cartago jail. All of  them young guys with supersized cocks. Frank Moreno, shot to death in Panama.  Oscar Guillermo Montes, shot to death in Puerto Berr&iacute;o. David Salazar, known as  the Anteater, shot to death in Palmira. Victims of vendettas or fortuitous  brawls. Evelio Latapia, hanged in a hotel room in Popay&aacute;n. Carlos Jos&eacute;  Santelices, stabbed by strangers in an alley in Maracaibo. Reinaldo Hermosilla,  last seen in El Progreso, Honduras. Dionisio Aurelio P&eacute;rez, shot to death in a  bar in Mexico City. Maximiliano Moret, drowned in the Mara&ntilde;&oacute;n  River. Ten-to-twelve inch cocks, sometimes so long they couldn&rsquo;t get them up.  Young mestizos, blacks, whites, Indians&mdash;sons of Latin America, whose only assets were  a pair of balls and a member tanned by exposure to the elements or by some  weird freak of nature, miraculously pink.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">The whole business is rather like a Punch and Judy show. You could see it like this: illnesses, all of them, are produced by nervous disorders. Disorders that have been engineered, cooly planned in advance, but by whom? By the patient, the environment, god or Destiny, what does it matter?... Hypnotism should reverse the process and bring about a cure. Should make it possible to forget, in other words. Pain and forgetting and their causes, and us caught up in the midst of it all, think about it for a moment...</p>
