  <p align="center" class="style6">SEASONAL MUSTACHE</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the earth travels and turns to point its eager face more directly at the sun, we in the northern hemisphere find ourselves with warmer weather, longer days and shorter skirts.&nbsp; For a gentleman the coming of spring should be a time to take a sort of personal inventory.&nbsp; After a long, hard winter he may find that his wardrobe is tired and go out to find a nice pair of trousers.&nbsp; Or he may glance about at the bare legs along city park pathways and feel a charging need for a little tender companionship.&nbsp; Of these and many other considerations a gentleman must make as spring blooms, near the top of his list should be his facial hair.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It goes without saying that a gentleman should sport some arrangement of facial hair.&nbsp; But what is appropriate for the dark, brutal days of winter is often inappropriate for the hopeful and joyous early days of spring.&nbsp; For instance, a full beard down past the Adam&rsquo;s apple is perfect for shielding the face from harsh winter winds, but come June or July is like wearing wool underwear at the beach; awful.&nbsp; Take this opportunity to try a new style!&nbsp; Shorten up that beard!!&nbsp; Let your face see the beautiful sun!!!</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beards are not the only types of facial hair that benefit from some seasonal pruning.&nbsp; Moustaches, maybe the most wonderfully subtle of facial hair styles, benefit greatly from a lighter, more summery style.&nbsp; In my mind, Marcello Mastroianni in &ldquo;Divorce, Italian Style&rdquo; sports the perfect summer moustache; trim and clean, it stands out without being showy.&nbsp; His is just one example of a seasonally appropriate moustache; there are many more to be found on faces you probably already know. </p>
  <div align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    <p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve never worn a moustache but have often thought about it, stealing furtive glances by the nightstand at photos in moustache magazines while your significant other sleeps beside you but thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the type of man to wear a moustache,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The style magazines all say that facial hair is d&eacute;class&eacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; What those &ldquo;Mad Men&rdquo; bandwagon jumping, high-rise style magazine writers don&rsquo;t tell you in the authoritative tone is that they are paid to invent fads.&nbsp; Every season a new shoe or a new actress or some new hat is &ldquo;all the rage.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some things never go out of style.&nbsp; Seasonally appropriate, well-maintained facial hair will long outlast the latest reality television show, miracle berry drink or restaurant menu trend.&nbsp; Now is the time to pull your face up by the handlebars and look your true self right in the mouth.</p>
