  <p class="style36"><strong>Please, Hammer, don't hurt 'em.</strong> </p>
  <p align="left" class="style15">MC Hammer loved&nbsp;horse racing.&nbsp;His father, like most  good fathers, got him into it. Hammer exhibited passion rarely seen in  the clubhouses of the New York racing circuit - one of the last bastions of the  American establishment, in the strictest sense of establishment. These  are the sort of folk who came over on the Mayflower and have been making money  hand over fist since. To set the scene, MC Hammer's Lite Light had  been&nbsp;previously&nbsp;defeated by Carl Icahn's Meadow Star. Icahn,  the billionaire owner of TWA, won a cash bet with Hammer and rumor had it that  the stakes had been raised to $200k for the Coaching Club of America Oaks.  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style15">If you think Hammer's choice of attire seems inappropriate, keep  in mind that the dress code only stipulates, &quot;Suits or  sports jackets are required for gentlemen. (Tie optional).&quot;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="style15">The magic starts around the 1:35 mark.</p>

  <p align="left" class="style36"><strong>MAN O'WAR</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="style35"> Man O'War died with an enormous erection that wouldn't go down. It's true. It's well documented. Ask anyone over at the Jot 'Em Down store. After repeated heart attacks at the age of thirty and servicing hundreds of mares, he finally succumbed. But his member remained permanently stiff. His member remembered. Obviously, there were no women present at his modest funeral just on the outskirts of Lexington. A black canvas sheet was draped ceremoniously over the rude appendage. Apparently two or three gentlemen in bowlers found it somewhat offensive, but they couldn't deny his great preponderance. </p>
