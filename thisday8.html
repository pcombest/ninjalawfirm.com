  <p align="left" class="style2">In fact, his only reaction to a low, clear-cut rap at his study was to make him speculate as to whether any rap would have actual existence without an ear to hear it. He fancied he was verging more and more toward pragmatism. But at that moment, though he did not know it, he was verging with astounding rapidity toward something quite different. <br />
    The rap sounded---three seconds leaked by---the rap sounded.</p>

She had a great view of the Parliament but was afraid to stop and allow the shadow to catch up. She decided to cross the suspension bridge with lion heads on it. For the first time, she noticed that the lions had no tongues. <br />
      <br />
    She had a flashed vision of her tongue being  cut off before the royal court. She turned around and the shadow of the Hungarian king (Was it Istvan?) bitch-slapped her and demanded her to go pick up her kids from her ex-husband's place. She started to run to do just that, but tripped and fell in the cold Duna. She swam momentarily and was relieved upon finding the water not to be as cold as she expected. She drew the attention of a boat going down the river blasting heavy-bass infused electronic music. The crew pulled her aboard the floating club and the dancers cheered.<br />

    She went to her ex-husband's to pick up her kids and argue about how little he pays in support.</p>

When she arrived it was November and the COLD had already settled there. She found a worker, Jan, and he lead her to the STORAGE FACILITY. Janice walked in, looked, and pointed at the wall to her left, &quot;There, right there, that's it. It even has my office's name and address on it.&quot; Jan shrugged and put the BOX onto a FLAT DOLLY. Janice stuck around until she saw the proper postage applied, and then, watched the package disappear down the BELT. It reminded her of her father's cremation.</p>

Like they took all the books from the shelves, piled them on the beach, and then, at the same time, with the blow of a rescue horn, set both the books and  the renovated shop on fire.

X for exploitation, X marking the spot of buried treasure, X meaning anything but the sorrow of a people without identity. Lee managed to reverse the original intention of the sign by converting it into merchandise. After turning the X into a style that can be effortlessly purchased, and imitated, he shortchanged its value even while it seemed to become profitable.</p>

Eventually though, this monkey started to let the status go to his head. He kept insinuating to Pusha and Pharrell that he wanted to get on a track, lay down a beat or rhyme.

    <p>The following is a conversation I recorded  between Ol' Dirty Bastard and Clint Eastwood at a special screening in Los  Angeles for the film&nbsp;<strong class="style2">The Bridges of Madison County</strong>. This is only a  small portion of a much-longer four-hour-plus transcript. This as-yet-unseen  transcript will serve as a guide to a 1,000-page novel I am currently writing  that is tentatively entitled&nbsp;<strong>The Diaper of Big Baby Jesus</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Ol' Dirty Bastard:</strong>&nbsp;Why are you dressed like a pilgrim?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Clint Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;A pilgrim?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, with that hat. Those shoes look like  Thanksgiving shoes too.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;It's for a movie I'm doing.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;Why would you do a movie with those shoes?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;I'm trying to get into character.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;Are you playing a gay?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;A gay?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;To me they look like a gay's shoes.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Why would I gaze at my shoes?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;No, a gay's shoes.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;I thought you said I look like a pilgrim.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;What's the difference?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;There's a big difference I think.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;You still like Dirty Harry?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;What do you mean?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;Do you like Dirty Harry?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Sure I like him. He was a good character to  play.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;When I was a boy I used to dress my sister up  like Dirty Harry but instead I called her Dirty Mary. She was messed up. I  remember on one of those days she was chasing me with a gun and I threw her  into a woodpile.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Why?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;Because she was taking it real. The bitch  thought she was you.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yeah?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;And she got a big splinter in her foot.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;I bet that hurt.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;I'm sure it hurt but I had to remind Dirty Mary  that she wasn't Dirty Harry, for real.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Right.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;The oddest thing about it was that the splinter  in her foot was in the shape of the Virgin Mary.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Right.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;It looked just like the Virgin Mary.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Why are you so wary?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;Wary?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;That's what you said?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;No, not wary... Mary... I said the Virgin Mary.  Her splinter looked like the Virgin Mary.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Oh.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;How old are you anyway?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Too old.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;The point of it was gonna be that people were  praying to my sister's foot.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Why did they do that?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;Because her splinter looked religious. All the  people in the projects were lining up to pray at my sister's foot.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Because the splinter was in the shape of the  Virgin Mary?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly, Clintdog.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;No, I'm vegetarian.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;Vegetarian?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;No hot dogs for me.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;I said &quot;Clintdog,&quot;&#157; not hot  dogs.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I gave up meat in the spring of '82.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;That's the same year I quit school.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;It was a good year for me.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;I got engaged that year to my pastor... a female  pastor.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;It did fly by much faster.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;What?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;For some reason 1982 seems like a blur. It was  one of those years that seems a dream now. It was a perfect year for me.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;I can't believe I'm sitting here with you now.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. It is strange.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;You're like an American icon and I'm like the  truest American icon.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, my children love your music. They say  you're one of the best.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;And you know Dirt Dog loves the children?&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>ODB:</strong>&nbsp;Two American originals... two Frank Sinatras.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Eastwood:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. He had blue eyes.&nbsp;<br />
