  <p align="left">Melinda and Thomas were two people: in love and doing it right, to some degree. When they would frequent social events Thomas would don a bow-tie and Melinda would call him Gene Kelly. They would tell stories of jumping into the stream in Munich&rsquo;s English Park and sip on wine, slowly moving into a world marked by heavy stenches. Nights would end when Thomas would tuck Melinda into bed. Then he would perform the same routine always:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
      <div align="left">Walking      into the bathroom, he would wash his face.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">He      would take off his shirt.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Thomas      would open the door, walk outside and down the stairs onto the street      below, spin three times and say: God, thank you for this life.</div>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p align="left">However, the one time he didn&rsquo;t come back inside, Melinda got worried and when she went outside Thomas was gone.<br />
    He never came back, only emailed three years later, asking her how things were.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A Matter of Fine Print&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left"><em>VINCE is onstage. He is energetic, maybe from the North: experienced, and a fast talker. He&rsquo;ll shoot straight with you on anything. This is one of those things.</em></p>
  <p align="left">VINCE: Exactly, see? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying: it&rsquo;s a matter of the law. Because you go in <em>there</em>, you go in, see what happens. They&rsquo;ll be ready for you, because it&rsquo;s not about what you were thinking, man, it&rsquo;s about what you did or what you do. I&rsquo;m telling you, there are not enough loopholes, man; because it <em>is </em>a matter of the law, see, and they&rsquo;ve&hellip;they&rsquo;ve mended whatever it was that was ailing with the whole fucking system.</p>
  <p align="left">And I&rsquo;ll be the first to tell you: it&rsquo;s crazy. And I know it just as well as you do because I was into the same thing, in for it all and they come down on me <em>hard</em> man, without a second option or opinion or whatever. Judge says &ldquo;law,&rdquo; I say &ldquo;balls.&rdquo; Because&hellip;what? Like I&rsquo;m to be expected to understand? What, man, I don&rsquo;t care how it goes, that shit&rsquo;s over my head. They say law, I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m in, because it&rsquo;s all fucking foreign to me. It&rsquo;s about lines, boundaries, fine print, man. And who the fuck reads the fine print?</p>
  <p align="left">Who really reads the fucking fine print, you know? And I don&rsquo;t want you to think&hellip;Oh, like he understands and I&rsquo;m clueless. Because you might be but I sure as hell don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m right there with you man. It <em>is </em>the law. Be that as it may &ndash; it&rsquo;s still something. Conditional, you know; it&rsquo;s based on conditions and experiences, and like I said, boundaries.</p>
  <p align="left">You just gotta know how to read it all. Put it all before you, think about <em>your</em>self, man, your <em>situation</em>, and what those boundaries, those conditions, mean to you. Because it is a matter of the law. And these days, man, that could mean anything.</p>
<p align="left" class="style23">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" class="style23">-------------------------</p>
<p align="center" class="style23">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center" class="style23">&quot;LISTEN&quot;  </p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">Listen: I&rsquo;m walking down the street in Italy. I&rsquo;ve been staying in Rome for about three months and at this point, I&rsquo;m feeling pretty comfortable. Sometimes, I believe, I could stay here all my life. Everything is just so breathtakingly beautiful. <br />
    I was watching a group of boys ride their bicycles a few days ago and it made me choke. I was having a banana and espresso on the Piazza Navona and a group of four rode past. They were young, all wearing khaki trousers, surely on the way home from Mass. One yelled to the rest: &ldquo;Wait, goddammit. You &ndash; wait!&rdquo; I did not want to watch too long; but of course, I could not help it. My gaze met their paths as they continued by, breaking the air and then fading into the streets beyond. I tried to watch them as long as I could but they were gone. I didn&rsquo;t know if I would ever see the boys again. Surely I would not. I finished my espresso. Things like this happen all the time. The sights eat me alive here. <br />
    Tell everyone. There is something about 45 minute en route from Nanges, France or a 15 minute, 20 dollar (plus tip) cab ride to make something feel worth it. I mean to really make something feel worthwhile. <br />
    Have you loved someone? Have you kissed the one you loved underneath the Eiffel Tower?&nbsp; I saw it from four blocks away &ndash; from the side &ndash; I was filming a pigeon overlooking the river and the tower looked plastic! Goddammit, did you sleep on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es or suck chocolates and Perrier on Saint Germain while your waiter mimics Americans, saying: &ldquo;Yo yo yo - you get yours and I&rsquo;ll have my big billiards?&rdquo; Have you felt the look on your face when you emerge from the Subway on 51st and tasted the people around you? Did you sleep in a FUCKING hostel with a girl from Palestine and a French couple fucking so loud in the bed nearby that you feel like jerking off? The adventures: to think that I have been privy to it all. Everything I could have dreamed about! Imagining, softly, in retrospect, the way I slept in the basement of a French girl named Claire who was so young, so soft. The way we played <em>Born to Run</em> on her French of a mother&rsquo;s turntable and made spaghetti while the family went away. To remember how we unearthed the South Park DVD from a dust riddled basement lined with bookshelves: the collections of two lovely French parents over years of school and love and work. To think of how I laid in year old sheets, unwashed, with the girl I love! A girl so goddamn beautiful that I smile awkwardly when I think about her. To remember the way we slept, back in her home, miles away in a fresher, more natural German landscape. O, to recount the days! The way we slept with the windows open, half dying from the scorching summer heat and cherishing the smooth winds of the morning when they brought us sounds from the street below the mountain. The wedding bells! The bicycles! The women walking to the Caf&eacute; to buy cakes! We were in the Black Mountains and we were skipping the world to take to the public pool and sit, lounge, drink, love on the hillside while she told me stories of the Nazi Party shelter nearby, still in use by Neo-Nazis. I crept down the hill and jumped into the water and I let it flow through me. Up my nose, bathing me in coolness. I closed my eyes tight and stopped everything and floated like I was in space or in the womb. I pulled my knees to my chest and just let the water guide me! For oh so long.<br />
    O world! O saddened peoples of faraway places: the way Chuck Taylor&rsquo;s feel on the Subway! The way pizza tastes with beer! The joyful things I can only recount and yet I feel a need to push, push, push them onto you. On everyone. To think about driving a roofless VW and eating a life&rsquo;s worth of Kiwis Becher. Caf&eacute; latte and techno music and love and doctor appointments and swollen eyes and new houses and showers without doors, family picnics, bike rides, train tracks, shoe stores, smiles, stones, feeding fish, eating pasta, acting like I am Michael Jackson and at some small point in my life I am king of the world in which I live.<br />
    There is something about this, this life. And it makes me want to die. It makes me so angry and at the same time it fills me with something so sharp and so divine that I want to move to Thailand and make something that lasts! O, the thoughts! Dear boy what love and perspiration I am left with! What divine crisis! Jesus Christ lift me up upon your cross and let the world have a look at me! Call them all to my place and let me sing them a song! Send me faraway and let the mountains take me because I am a bird dipping my wings in paints and when I fly I will paint the entire world in the only way I know how: like Basquiat, singing a Beatles song, because, goddammit, that&rsquo;s my life &ndash; and from the womb to the tomb it shall be.<br />
    Now, I hear dogs barking; and the boys from the Piazza are outside throwing stones at my window: &ldquo;Come out, American! We want to play kickball in the street and we need someone to be all-time defense!&rdquo;</p>

  <p align="center"><strong>&quot;Where Is Your Help When We Need It?&quot;</strong>  </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was Lita, but I liked to call her Lola. The movie &ldquo;Run Lola Run&rdquo; had been popular in Germany, her home. And so, looking for chuckles, I would often watch her run, screaming &ldquo;Run!...Lola!...Run!&rdquo; sort of half hearted and childlike. <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because she had seen the film &ldquo;Forrest Gump&rdquo; in her history class and had marked it a favorite of hers (<em>so cute!) </em>she would strike back at my taunts with a &ldquo;Run!...Forrest!...Run!&rdquo; Of course, my name is not Forrest, nor does it lend itself to even a comparison; but I found the attempt rather enjoyable. As a treat, I would reward her with an overly dramatic run, which, if one had been some miles away, would have looked painfully awkward. I bent my knees inward as far as I could, touching them together if possible, and kicked my legs out as forcefully as I could. She told me I looked like Gumby when I did that. I claimed I could run for days and she kissed me.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she said.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day our lives crumbled we had been running, too.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were not watching each other run, but rather, she was trailing me quickly. It was a lazy run, brisk as it may have been, but our arms and legs were flailing as if to say: <em>look, we both know this is fun. </em>It was a <em>I&rsquo;m gonna get you</em> run and we savored it. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had called her a retard and she threw a daffodil in my face. There we were: running - me away from her, laughing at the top of our lungs and gulping down the sharp summer air into our lungs. Soon we grew tired and I eventually gave up and granted her my capture. <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I get you!&rdquo; she screamed. She collapsed onto my back in one smooth motion. She felt like marshmallows, a wonderful blend of smooth, firm yet somehow forgiving. I let the bare skin of her arms touch my own. She was warm.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Christ.&rdquo;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;See, I told you I am faster. Much faster,&rdquo; she proclaimed. She let me go and pushed me softly from behind. &ldquo;You are bullshit.&rdquo;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She often said things like this: <em>You are bullshit</em>. And while, under normal circumstances it may not have made complete sense, it worked for me and I lived for these remarks. We shared a laugh and for a few moments we discussed the validity of her statement.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re bullshit,&rdquo; I argued.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are.&rdquo;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are.&rdquo;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bullshit, bulshit, bushit.&rdquo; Letters bounced around her tongue as she repeated herself.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; I gave up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bullshit. But you&rsquo;re &hellip; retarded!&rdquo;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lunged at me and caught me with her arms again as we fell to the ground laughing. We were well received by the grass so we took to our backs, exchanging kisses periodically and talking about songs we liked to sing.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told her I loved to sing a David Bowie song I had heard on my dad&rsquo;s record player - &ldquo;Changes&quot; - I think -- and sang her a few lines as she turned over and rested her elbows on my stomach. I cringed a bit.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Turn and face the strange cha-cha-changes!</em><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pushed harder on my stomach. Her elbows were sharp.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hurt me. My abs are made of steel.&rdquo;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was surely about to tell me about the songs she liked to sing but she didn&rsquo;t get the chance. She raised her head and peered over me into the creek below. She looked serious. Worried.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My God.&rdquo;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kept looking, raising her head higher to get a better view of whatever it was she saw. Her elbows dug trenches in my chest. <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, get offa me.&rdquo; I pushed her to the side. But she said nothing &ndash; only looked beyond me, down below.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; she asked &ndash; her voice trembled softly. She pointed into the brush below, and my eyes followed her motion. It was unclear at first. There were weeds everywhere and wild flowers had grown tall in the area. But it soon became clear. I had never seen something so disturbing and all was soon quiet. <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I died and my ears fell off.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the creek, hidden behind the determined growth was a small body. It could have been a doll, I told myself, but I knew that there was nothing but real flesh that looked so thick. We could not get a complete view of the whole thing - it took a moment to focus. From what I could see it was a 10 year old. Surely no older. It had been thrown like a used parachute into the creek. It had been full once, glorious with air and visible from all points. Its purpose was gone now.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arms rested at the sides; but it appeared strewn, not carefully placed. It was a person thrown from a car. It was a joke. A sick fucking joke, right.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a boy &ndash; the hair was short. It was dark brown and matted to the skull from the water in the creek. There was some blood, not much, spotting the shirt. A fucking joke, these people. How real it is.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; We felt like crying.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young body was certainly lifeless. I wanted to climb down into the creek, to rescue him, but I found my limbs useless. I tried to lift my foot; the world was upon me. The weight was extreme. My heart burst.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go get someone.&rdquo; I was not sure if my words were clear; Lita sat next to me. Her face went white and she couldn&rsquo;t move either. Trees withered and something sounded, wheels losing traction or birds being incinerated. A boom in the distance.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Goddammit, go get someone.&rdquo;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not sure who she should get. I didn&rsquo;t believe there was anyone who could really help and I knew there was nothing to be done.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go fucking get someone Lita!&rdquo;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was still.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lay there, helpless, and wondered what it must be like to live in a world where things don&rsquo;t happen to bring people toppling down. We were not sure if we were living anymore &ndash; and for some moments I believed I was a bird and I could fly away from everything cold and rough in the world. There were mountains somewhere to call my home &ndash; there were other birds, too, they would make me feel comfortable, surely.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months later I visited Lita in Germany and she admitted to me it felt weird when I kissed her. I tried to make things easier by running; but it all felt forced, worthless.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">&ldquo;Dear Nasir&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left"><em>Lights up. Bruce La Bruce, a man from a distant land, stands onstage. He comes from the East, we know, but we have no actual idea of where. He lives in America now, and this is obvious from his dress. It is sporty, though outdated. An old pair of Nike&rsquo;s or Reebok&rsquo;s, and a sweat suit with bright colors. He has an envelope in his hand. He kneels down, places the letter on the floor, and stands again. He speaks to the audience, though reciting the letter he has just written to his son Nasir, in jail. His English is broken and confused.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>BRUCE LA BRUCE: </strong>Dear Nasir. I'm writing to you because you are my son and it has been so long since we last spoke. Fathers and sons need to keep maintenance and relish conversation. I think you should know about things going on in my life, as I would like to know what things transpire for you, though I may not have the chance to see you as oft I wish. This at points animates tears upon my face.</p>
  <p align="left">Your next of kin are doing well, as Samantha has just entered her second year at University. She is studying hard, always bringing home sheets of geography and of letters and speaking of the rapport she is having with several professors in her field. She is a beautiful girl, Nasir, and I think you would agree with me when I say she is a beautiful girl. If I can produce a photograph or a sketch done well in pen and ink I shall hope to post it to you so that you may have it there in your cell to ponder. You surely grow weary over the vast separation that has occurred twixt the two of you. I shall hope to mend this vastness. As your father, it is my duty.</p>
  <p align="left">Nico lives in a fine manner, too. He produces drum-beats for a local band and he has developed a rapport, also. Our family, Nasir, may not be rich, but we are doing well to do well when complications reign.</p>
  <p align="left">As for me, I must say, I remain non-motionless, having committed myself to several clubs in the surrounding metropolitan area. One such club includes golf playing and beer drinking, which your father finds to be very residual. It is comforting, no? Yes, I knew it would be.</p>
  <p align="left">I have played much golf and consumed many beers (chilled) since your mother passed into yesteryear. She was a real tornado and kept me on my feet whilst she lived, though now I am content and resigned to playing golf and drinking beer served cold rather than sulking out my days in a long and hard manner. This is what I have learned we must do, Nasir, trudge on in the face of adversity and in the midst of timetables. Sometimes things don&rsquo;t go exactly as we had planned them to exactly go, and that&rsquo;s when a good rapport can help you, son. You must look inside, too &ndash; for nearly all that can be mended shall be mended from the faculties of your beating heart. And take up crosswording, it is a good thing.</p>
  <p align="left">I speak too soon, of course, for they do not have crosswording last I checked in the jails; but no worries, I can post a collection of puzzles your sister and I have completed in hindsight. I will be quick to replete our answers, and make the book like new again. Keep steadfastly trucking and pursue your path with ambivalence. Soon we shall see you bi-proxy and then our love will be made manifest for all to see. This is not a question I regard with doubt for I know its aptitude to be likely.</p>
  <p align="left">The love I have for you is immeasurable, Nasir. You are my son and I am your father. The blood that makes us so is a blood I cannot forget, for it lives in me in the greatest context. Please don't forget that, boy. Stay strong, exist powerfully and live dutifully. Love - Bruce la Bruce, your heroic father who mastered nature to bring you to fruition.</p>

Well Rich puts this record on, right, Side One. And it&rsquo;s starting to spin and I&rsquo;m sitting there, right, like, eager but not really expecting to be blown away. To me, it&rsquo;s whatever.</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="style3"><strong>Well, the record starts and I hear this guy, right. He gets on the microphone and he says: &ldquo;And now for your Rumble Room ears: the dangerous duet, Miles Davis and Frankie Little.&rdquo; My god, man, listen: Frankie Little. Frankie Little. That&rsquo;s my father. My dad, the drum man, you know? And, hey, I mean. He loved jazz. And I knew he played, a little, you know? But&Ouml;But not like this. I mean. Listen: this record was beautiful. The way they got together, and I mean, the way the sound looped, enveloped the room, caught you and squeezed you and let you go and chased you. It broke my heart. Man, it broke my heart it was so beautiful. It was like, unbelievable. Up and down and up and down and Miles would break and my pops &ntilde; yo I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m saying this &ntilde; my dad would beat right back at him.</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="style3"><strong>And I started thinking: if there&rsquo;s room, you know, for a love, a passion, an outpouring of beauty like that in this world, man, then everything don&rsquo;t matter. If there is something, out there, on that level, you know, I mean, on that level. That one level. That level that makes you sit back and be human for like, two fucking hours! Like raw human. A beautiful animal. </strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="style3"><strong>If there&rsquo;s room for that, then this life ain&rsquo;t so bad you know? If there&rsquo;s room for that kind of beauty, then we&rsquo;ll all just be fine. We&rsquo;ll be fine, man. We&rsquo;ll be fine.  </strong></p>

  <p align="center">&quot;Come Together But Swiftly So&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The cars felt so ineffectual.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were driving and had been for some time; but everything outside our world felt fake. Like plastic. It was. It certainly could have been.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a brief moment when I remembered the crash we had faked three years prior. Sounds much more complicated than it was, really. There was a video. Just a video. And we were driving and the quality was grainy. There was some piano playing in the background, and he was talking, and we sort of planned a scream, like this:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yell, camera screeches forward, CUT.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that order. And so in the end what we had was a realistic looking car crash scene and it fooled everyone. Even myself.
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, three years later, when I saw myself flying through the air, it felt like a movie. The way his head snapped back, it seemed like perfection in makeup and editing technology.
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it wasn&rsquo;t. It was very real, and I lay there on the road, bleeding profusely from my ear, thinking: <em>Holy fuck &ndash; it was all so real and we must have been too stupid to see it.</em>  </p>

  <p align="center">&quot;About Monkeys&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">WOMAN: You&rsquo;d be amazed at the sheer size of these animal communities. Some say they haven&rsquo;t even been measured as well as they could be. I specialize in monkeys &ndash; selling those little motherfuckers. There&rsquo;s all kinds of monkeys, if you didn&rsquo;t know. Cocksucking monkeys, bullshitting monkeys, nurturing monkeys; all kinds. Those little critters are pains in the ass, too, but they&rsquo;re selling like fucking hotcakes right now &ndash; down in Georgia &ndash; sold a nice little monkey there &ndash; Governor&rsquo;s daughter. No shit. Shoulda seen the look on her face when she took that little shit. Man, it was classic. That was a biting monkey right there, yes sir.</p>

  <p align="center">&ldquo;A Queer Tea Tale&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23"><em>FLORIAN is onstage. He  wears clothes suggestive of the period of his speech: possibly Victorian  England dress.</em></p>
  <p align="left" class="style23"><strong>FLORIAN:</strong> I  traveled to Igor&rsquo;s house yesterday, and the oddest thing happened. It seems as  though he&rsquo;d purchased a new mirror. A new mirror! Can you fathom?</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">It was a beautiful mirror, I must say. Not too large, and  framed in a rather ornate manner. The frame was wonderful. It appeared like  plated gold worn and weathered from time and use. Many faces, it seemed, had  peered into that mirror. Yet it was new. Isn&rsquo;t that the oddest thing?</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">He placed it in his sitting room, above the mantle, but in a  queer fashion: it was placed too high. I attempted to experiment with it and  straighten my tie and collar, but I could not. Igor had placed the mirror in a  way that rendered it useless to all, halfway up the wall. And Igor&rsquo;s ceilings  are nearly 15 feet high! Isn&rsquo;t that funny? Don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">As we were taking tea, I asked him: why buy a mirror so nice  and then hang it on a wall at a height where no one can use it? You can hardly  take the crown of your head in, Igor.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">He looked at me and said: Florian, the mirror is doing what  I bought it to do. It&rsquo;s showing you all you need to know.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">We resumed tea, but Igor&rsquo;s response struck me as particularly  odd. What <em>was </em>the mirror meant to do,  I wondered. What possible use would a mirror provide if no one could look into  it and find oneself reflected back?</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">When Igor turned to summon Margaret for sweet biscuits and  marmalade, I grabbed my saucer and threw it across the room. It struck the  mirror at the corner and caused it to fall to the ground in one hundred pieces.  Smashed.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">Igor heard the crash, turned and looked at me cross, wiped  the corners of his mouth free and resumed: why, Florian, you have broken my  mirror. For what reason, he asked.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">Igor, I began, the mirror is not broken. The mirror has  simply multiplied into many new, smaller mirrors. Twas not I, but the saucer  that has made this happen, I said.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">I&rsquo;m not sure what I meant by that, I&rsquo;ll admit, but as we  took biscuits, a smile became fixed upon Igor&rsquo;s face, and I could tell he  enjoyed the subtlety of my wit.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">Isn&rsquo;t that such a queer thing? Don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
