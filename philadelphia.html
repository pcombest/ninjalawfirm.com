  <p class="style21"><strong>Girl, 11, faces paralysis after dad shoots her in face</strong></p>
  <p class="style23">by Frank Kummer and Darran Simon</p>
  <p class="style23">&#8224; CAMDEN EDITION &#8224;</p>
    <div align="left">
      <p class="style21">An 11-year-old girl was shot in the face last night by her father, who was, in turn, shot by someone else in a Camden rowhouse, according to the Camden County Prosecutor's Office.<br />
        <br />
      The shooting occurred around 9:30 p.m. on the 1300 block of Thurman Street, authorities said. The girl was taken to Cooper University Hospital where she is listed as in critical but stable condition.<br />
      <br />
        Authorities say there is a chance the girl could &quot;suffer paralysis.&quot;<br />
        <br />
        &quot;It was not an accident,&quot; said Jason Laughlin, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. &quot;He pointed a gun at her face and pulled the trigger.&quot;<br />
        <br />
        According to the Camden County Prosecutor's office, the following occurred:<br />
        The girl was in her home on the 1300 block of Thurman Street when her father, Byaer Johnson, 27, arrived. Johnson has addresses in Sicklerville, Camden and Lindenwold.<br />
        <br />
        Johnson was at the house to visit the girl when he suddenly pulled out a handgun and put it on the floor. He was asked by someone at the home to leave.<br />
        <br />
        Johnson then allegedly picked up the gun and shot the girl in the face. He then pointed the gun at another man in the home and pulled the trigger, the prosecutor's office said.<br />
        <br />
        The weapon jammed.<br />
        <br />
        The intended target - a 28-year-old Camden man - wrestled with Johnson. The man struck Johnson several times with the gun, then fired it at him. Johnson was shot in the buttocks.<br />
        <br />
        Police found Johnson running toward the Ivy Hill apartment complex in Camden and arrested him. He was charged with attempted murder, and weapons violations.<br />
        <br />
        He was taken to Cooper for treatment and is expected to be transferred to the Camden County Jail.</p>

  <p class="style21"><strong>Phillies give ballgirl wannabes more time</strong></p>
  <p class="style23">By Peter Mucha  </p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Women wishing to be a Phillies ballgirl now have more time to get in that video application.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">The new deadline: Monday.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">The club is expanding its squad from 15 to 20 for the 2013 season, to cover an ever-growing array of duties, from patrolling foul territory during games to a lengthy lineup of fund-raising and promotional activities, said Michele DeVicaris, who oversees the ballgirls as the Phillies' manager for community and charity events.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Undetermined is how many members of the current squad will return.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Besides resumes, application packages should include a two-minute DVD summing up softball experience and other valuable qualities.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Softball skills are a must because the squad plays at least 10 charity games each year.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Candidates must also be at least 18 and know the game of baseball, while having a very flexible schedule, public relations or communications training, and a friendly personality.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Requested information should be mailed to: The Phillies, Citizens Bank Park, One Citizens Bank Way, Philadelphia, PA 19148. Note on the envelope: ATTN: BALLGIRL APPLICANT.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">In their duties as goodwill ambassadors for the Phillies, the ballgirls will likely make about 200 off-field appearances next year - everything from TV and radio interviews to golf and bowling tournaments to visits to schools and nursing homes, said DeVicaris</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Those who make the first cut will be invited to tryouts at Citizens Bank Park.  </p>

  <p align="center" class="style21"><strong>Two suspects - just 7 and 9 years old - couldn't be charged in Juniata beating</strong></p>
  <p align="center" class="style23">by Julie Shaw</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">The police detective investigating the brutal beating and robbery Monday of Minh Tran, a 51-year-old Vietnamese immigrant in her Juniata Park home, said Wednesday that one of the two remaining suspects is a mere 7 years old and that he believes the other is only 9.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">But because both are under 10 and this is not a murder case, they cannot be criminally prosecuted under Pennsylvania law.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">A 10-year-old boy, called the &quot;ringleader&quot; by police, of L Street near Luzerne, was arrested Monday after being turned in by his mother. He faces trial on aggravated assault and related offenses in Family Court Aug. 22, said Tasha Jamerson, spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office.  </p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Detective Martin Sheeron, the assigned detective, said Wednesday that he wanted to investigate further to make sure the 9-year-old was involved. If that's the case, and he and the 7-year-old, who both live near the victim, can't be prosecuted, Sheeron said he would sit down with their parents &quot;to find out what's going <span class="style21">on.&quot;</span></p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">He said he would refer them to the Department of Human Services for possible supervision.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Frank Cervone, executive director of the Support Center for Child Advocates, said these kids' behaviors are warning signs. &quot;There's a red flag that there are neglect issues and these kids are acting out in this way,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">On Monday afternoon, Tran was sleeping in her studio apartment on Luzerne Street near L. She was awoken when three boys barged in and began beating her with a rope, sticks, a potted plant and a plunger. They stole $20 from her.  </p>

  <p align="center" class="style23">by Mensah M. Dean</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Kendall Anderson, the South Philadelphia teen who confessed to fatally beating his mother with a claw hammer and trying to cremate her in the oven because she took his PlayStation 2 away in November 2010, has pleaded guilty and been sentenced to a lengthy stay in state prison.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Anderson, 17, who formerly attended the disciplinary Daniel Boone School and lived with his mother on Jackson Street near 4th, on May 4 entered into a negotiated guilty plea to third-degree murder, possession of an instrument of crime, abuse of a corpse and related crimes connected to the Nov. 28, 2010 death of Rashida Anderson, 37.</p>

  <p align="center" class="style23">by Laura Cofsky</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">One man was killed early Easter morning in a shooting on the Schuylkill Expressway near the Montgomery Drive exit that closed the highway for three hours.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Police said they do not believe the shooting was random.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Police have identified the victim as Kareem El, 29, hometown unknown. El was driving a silver 1997 Buick LeSabre eastbound on the highway about 2:50 a.m. when an unknown vehicle pulled up along its passenger side and fired numerous shots inside, according to Pennsylvania State Police.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Who did the shooting remains unknown.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Philadelphia police had discovered the Buick stopped in the middle of the road and alerted state police.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">While there have been other shootings on what is one of the city's heaviest-used roads, this is the first to occur in the Montgomery Drive area, said state police Sgt. David Milligan.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">&quot;There's no indication that there was a random shooter,&quot; Milligan said. &quot;But right now we're looking at everything. We're trying to see if there was a reason [the driver] was targeted.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Although the shooting occurred when traffic wasn't especially heavy, Milligan said he thinks there might have been witnesses, perhaps passing motorists who were unaware that a shooting was taking place.  </p>

  <p align="center" class="style23">by Julie Shaw</p>
  
  <p align="left" class="style21">IN YET ANOTHER home invasion of an Asian business owner, an Oxford Circle man says that he and his wife were ambushed as they pulled into their back driveway Sunday night in their black Lexus.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">The husband, a 42-year-old Korean American who goes by the nickname Kenny but did not want his name published, Monday showed the Daily News a home surveillance video that captured the attackers as they pounced from behind a fence, surprising the couple.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">The man and his wife had just returned home from their West Philly beer-distribution business, which also sells lottery tickets.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">About 7:05 p.m., the first thug rushed with a gun toward Kenny - who was walking to the other side of his car - and yelled, &quot; 'Don't move,' &quot; Kenny said, and took the $3,000 that Kenny had in his pocket. A number of accomplices then ran to the passenger-side door and took $4,000 from the man's wife.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">The video showed six thugs wearing hooded sweatshirts. They forced the husband to open his rear basement door. Soon after, his wife was seen in the video, crawling on her knees and pushed to the door by one attacker.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">After they were inside the house, on McKinley Street near Castor Avenue, a seventh assailant appeared in the driveway. When a neighbor's garage door opened, he fled.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">The robbers, four with guns, were in the house for about seven minutes. They fled with about $30,000 in cash, including the $7,000 stolen outside.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">In the driveway, they also took the husband's handgun, which he had on his hip and which he had a legal permit to carry.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Inside the house, the robbers kicked Kenny on the ground in his side and head and hit him four times with a gun in the back of his head. One thug said he would count down from 5 and then shoot, Kenny said. The attacker counted, &quot;5, 4, 3, 2, 1,&quot; and Kenny told them they had already taken the couple's money outside. The thug then counted down again, and Kenny said he then told them the money was upstairs and they should &quot;take anything.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Meanwhile, his 40-year-old Korean American wife, who had been taken to an upstairs bedroom by other attackers, had a gun pointed to her head, Kenny said.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">He said he didn't get a good look at the robbers' faces because they were wearing masks, kept yelling, &quot;Don't look at me!&quot; and ordered him to close his eyes. He described them as African American and in their 20s.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">In the video, about 7:12 p.m. a neighbor rang the couple's rear doorbell. Shortly after, the six thugs ran out the back door.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Police have a copy of the video.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Kenny said the house had been burglarized three times before, when he and his wife were not home. Less than $5,000 was taken, and no one has been arrested.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">With this latest attack, Kenny and his wife plan to move.</p>

    Man arrested in killing of neighbor in dispute over dog waste  </strong></p>
  <p align="center" class="style23">by Joseph Gambardello and Morgan Zalot</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">A 27-year-old man was arrested this morning and charged with shooting and killing a neighbor over dog droppings Tuesday afternoon in Tacony.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Police said Tyrirk Harris fired his 9mm pistol at least six times, killing Franklin Manuel Santana, 47.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Both men lived just doors apart on the 6500 block of Torresdale Avenue.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Neighbors said Harris allowed his Chihuahua and a German shepherd to defecate on lawns on the street and did not clean up after his pets.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Sometime after 4 p.m. Tuesday, Santana confronted Harris over the dog droppings, police said.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">&quot;I seen them arguing, then from there a little scuffle,&quot; said neighbor Miguel Rivera, 37, who was walking by at the time. &quot;Then I heard the shots.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Santana fell wounded with mutiple gunshot wounds to the face and chest, police said. Medics pronounced him dead at the scene at 4:25 p.m.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">&quot;Any type of argument or fight that's gonna lead to gunfire is a terrible thing,&quot; Police Chief Inspector Scott Small said at the scene.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">A red Valentine's heart decorated the door above where Santana fell mortally wounded, an eerie reminder of the loved ones left behind by the city's 48th homicide victim of the year.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Neighbors said he and his wife had recently moved onto the block and had a 2-month-old baby.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">&quot;I can't believe it,&quot; said neighbor Patricia Batista, 58, shaking her head. &quot;To take somebody's life over that.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">&quot;It's kind of ridiculous that a person has to lose his life over a dog,&quot; Rivera said.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">After the slaying, neighbors gathered on porches and in the street, looking on as investigators combed the scene.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Harris' girlfriend, tears streaming down her face, alternately knelt with her head against a wrought-iron railing and paced a neighbor's porch.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">She declined to comment, but neighbors and police sources said Harris was a former school police officer.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">He was charged with murder, firearms violations and possession of an instrument of crime. Harris wa<span class="style21">s </span>ordered held without bail at his arraignment this morning. His next court date was set for Feb. 29.</p>

  <p align="center" class="style23">by Morgan Zalot and Phillip Lucas</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Plumbers working on a house in Kensington made a gruesome discovery late Monday afternoon -- a human fetus in a basement sewer pipe.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Police said a plumber and his assistant were working in a house on Russell Street near G around 4 p.m. when they made the discovery. They were in the basement trying to clear a clog in pipes connected to the toilet when they found the fetus stuck in the pipe, said Chief Inspector Scott Small.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Investigators preliminarily estimated the unborn fetus, which they said was about the size of a man's fist, to be about 14 to 16 weeks old. They said it did not appear to be decomposed.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">&quot;It may not be a crime scene,&quot; Small said outside the house as neighbors gathered on the narrow street. &quot;It appears someone may have had a miscarriage.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Small said the men who found the fetus were taken to speak with investigators in the Special Victims Unit. He added that the Medical Examiner was at the scene and would perform an autopsy to determine the age of the fetus, whether it was viable and how long it had been in the pipe.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Police expressed concern for the woman involved, saying she's likely in need of medical attention.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style21">Neighbors and police said a couple in their 60s had recently moved into the house. Police said they do not believe the woman who lives there was pregnant, so they're looking into who else may have been in the property recently.</p>
