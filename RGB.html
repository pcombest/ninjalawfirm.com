<p align="left" class="style9"><strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong> The indignities were nothing new&mdash; the overweight steamer trunks, being called by one's first name if one was lucky, &quot;boy&quot; if one wasn't &mdash; but membership in the Brotherhood of the Sleeping-Car Porters could provide some psychic shelter from the day-to-day grind. Much of the group was made up of recent veterans of World War II and its jurisdiction included the Beaux-Arts wind tunnels of Union Station, DC, and the wedding-cake splendor of Grand Central. Threaten to cross the picket line and you'll find yourself circled by knives. The group's leader, Theophilus Stacks, brought to every meeting the bundt cakes that his wife &mdash; known for the two strict victory-curls that straddled her forehead &mdash; baked. You could spot the Brothers by the color of their jackets, which added an extra icy oomph to the standard-issue scarlet.<br />

<p class="style9"><strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong> The youngest prince in Poland's history at age 12, Biebers Kapowski decided one day after &quot;lev&eacute;e&quot; (during which 25-30 people with nothing better to do observed his rising from bed and performing his morning prayers and toilette) to cut out of this gilded 14-century piece and hit the streets solo. You know the prince/pauper song and dance by now; our little infanto traded in his gold-threaded slippers for a pair of pointed leather poulaines -- dyed a shade that was one part city-dingy, one part wilderness-energetic -- the minute he landed on the sidewalks Bedzin. In between turns on the double-dutch court, he texted his mom Princess Judith a bit of advice she would turn around in her mind for years to come: &quot;Whenever you feel like cursing our family's paternalistic hierarchy, just remember that not everyone in Bedzin has had the breaks you've had.&quot; </p>

<p class="style9"><strong>History and First Recorded Mention: </strong>Edwardian Atlanta, those were the fucking days &mdash; tails, tophats, grandfather clocks rotting in the humidity. Vampiresses in their lace and bustles. The beau monde of that time was savagely classist (as you can imagine) and became a social challenge and the eventual white whale of retired rope-splicer Dexter Constantine. Love was what brought him there (he'd fallen for a girl, Viola something, who got married off to some frail buffer and shot away to the mountains) but he ended up continuing his mission on principle. When he finally got invited to a summer solstice fete, he was so nervous about what to wear that he was the last guest to arrive. Everyone was seated around the table and staring up at him with woozy eyes when Lenore, the hostess, pushed toward him a tube-thin crystal glass filled with a liquid aperitif he'd never seen before, its color blazing like a savanna at noon.</p>

  <strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong> A silky voiced, silky legged translator on the wrong end of a bunch of failed love affairs, No&eacute;mi Blaise-Blanc walked into the cafeteria one day at UNESCO headquarters, jacket shoulders sharp and the eatery&rsquo;s famed quenelles on the brain. A gangster architectural vista blazing out the window, YSL&rsquo;s Opium in the air. 7 Place de Fontenoy. (We&rsquo;re talking Pari, people.) As she lifted a quenelle to her lip, the rubber tip of a crutch crushed down onto her left foot. No&eacute;mi&rsquo;s gaze snapped up and landed on the glorious face of Olivia Dupond, who, sans apology, offered to take No&eacute;mi home to put ice on the bruise that was quickly turning over into a shade of seething plum. No&eacute;mi nodded, slipping her sweating bottle of Lorina into her purse.&nbsp;<br />

  <strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong> Stamps O&rsquo;Rourke was on a hot streak. His variety show was wildly popular coast to coast (Nielsen had only been counting TV ratings for a handful of years; Stamps paid more attention to the reduced toilet flushing rates when he was on air) thanks to the way the show bulged with from the tension and talent of its guests. Bohemians, crew-cut townies, conga lines, Black Panthers. But that wasn&rsquo;t the only draw: What set Stamps apart were his long on-air silences that cleaved through conversations with starlets and politicians. People tuned in to see how long they&rsquo;d last from night to night. The guests flocked too, and when they flocked, they prepared for their interviews inside a waiting room painted in one gleaming, hedonistically spoiled color.<br />

One day at a diner he left them before the menus even came, just bounced and left a hunnie to say thanks, but it was actually cash from a state he was en route to establish. The superlative inkwork was all done up in a humming, sexed-up hue.&nbsp;<br />

  <strong>History and First Recorded Mention:&nbsp;</strong>Algernon Chalmers was the leading feather specialist during the true dawn of disco, the era of the can-can revue. His costumes were bonkers in-demand because they were tinted using a formula that only he knew, a color he dedicated to his sister Odette, 20 years gone, who&rsquo;d succumbed to childhood tuberculosis. Even in her last days she never stopped playfully sticking out her tongue &mdash; which glowed a consumptive, paranormal hue &mdash; at her doting brother.&nbsp;<br />

Anyway,  afterward, they decamped to their wedding present, a brand-new Airstream  trailer. Model name: Bambi. The thing was a glam little toastermobile; the  honeymooners hitched it up to the Chevy and started the engine. When Gene and  Lenore peeled off, the Bambi&rsquo;s tires began to kick up a cloud that was  sun-tinged and skittish and gleaming with a color that was distinctly  sarcastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="style9"><strong>History and First Recorded Mention:&nbsp;</strong>Cricket  star Ahmed Aggarwal was pure starch and swagger, and he was the highest wicket  taker in the world. In the throbbing lead-up to the 1954 World Cup of Cricket,  his most ardent fans -- who called themselves Aggarwal-Flowers -- published a  booklet full of their grand-champeen idol&rsquo;s memorable quotes. In short order,  every match was leafleted with these booklets. The covers were saturated in one  especially pushy, vying color. <br />

<strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong>&nbsp;Fresh out of architecture school and high on  talent but low on connections, Kaylee Willows was near the bottom on the totem  pole of an uber-firm that built Southern California garage-Mahals. Maybe it was  the Santa Ana winds, maybe it was the vegetable sorrow of so many palm trees  planted outside their native habitat, but Kaylee got a few letters or numbers  mixed up one day. Next thing she knew, all the mega-Tuscan houses coming up  were painted in this shade. </p>

  <strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong>&nbsp;Jackie  Thermopolis was a Studio 54 party boy, an insatiable sex-industrialist, and  mousy journalist Kathy Shaw &mdash; whose hobbies included writing, calisthenics,  origami, and being mousy &mdash; was assigned to write a profile on him. Inside small  private rooms of the danceclub, she recorded his every sticky move, then at 5  AM he took her back to his Midtown penthouse. The place was to be expected &mdash;  shaggy surfaces, an oily haze in the air &mdash; but after some snooping Kathy  discovered a cabinet full of nerdy porcelain miniatures. Foxes, rabbits, cats,  urchins receiving First Communion. Kathy stole a small china pigeon painted in  a striking color, as a souvenir.</p>

    <br />
    <strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong>&nbsp;Prudence Dempsey was  making quite the name for herself within the painterly circles of the mid-19th  century. Her claim to fame? When you were in need of a cranky Pre-Raphaelite  angel, Prudence Dempsey was the best there was. One of the first true  model/muses. Celebrated artist Sir Gerard Jasper fell for her, fell hard, after  seeing her face because it reminded him of the silhouette on an ancient coin he  found once during his boyhood in Cairo. The canvas not even halfway completed,  they ran off together on his boat and were never seen again; just a flash of  the sail &mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this color &mdash; as the vessel skulled the English  Channel, and then they were gone.&nbsp; <br />

  <strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong> When reality stars first began to expire (relevance-wise, click-through-rates-wise),  these stars were dispatched to a small, little-known island marooned in the  middle of the South Pacific. The sand squished attractively, the fruity wind  tumbled, but, turned out, the island was a totalitarian state. Whoops! One day,  in an attempt to lift morale, the dictator&nbsp;started censoring documents  with a new, peppy hue recommended to him by his second-in-command, Boodles  Monaghan.&nbsp;<br />

    <strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong> You know how, when you feel all botanical and blunted and held hostage by something more potent than you'd expected -- you get all paranoid and convinced that your thoughts are being advertised above your head? That's because they are. Those thoughts and feelings get erected in the air directly above you; they are made of Lucite and written in bright yellow letters in a slanting, expanding font. They are outlined in red and are held up by a system of groaning, rickety metal beams in this shade. So no point even trying to keep your mouth shut. <br />

  <strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong> With a juvenile size-7 wig powdered in pricey opalescent talcum, Lenhard Jorg was the great rosy hope of the town of Kaprun, Austria. Basically, Lenhard was Justin-Fucking-Bieber before Justin Bieber was Justin Bieber. By age 11,  Lenhard had composed a dozen symphonies and two operas. His secret was that he would rub the sounds on his head against the inside of his forearm. As he suffered from dermatographism, the rubbing would propel his mast cells into batshit mutiny, causing angry lines (in this shade) to rise from his skin, eventually revealing the precise musical notation of his next composition. <br />

<p class="style9"><strong>History and First Recorded Mention:</strong>&nbsp;In 1961, the city of Atlanta issued an ordinance forbidding its African-American citizens from smelling any flower (including Georgia&rsquo;s state flower, the fragrant Cherokee Rose) growing inside of a public park. In response to the statute, the Sweet Auburn section of town decked out its own neighborhoods with fluffy purple Santigraya roses that smelled like almonds; lilacs; gardenias; sweet olive; Neoprene-scented moonflowers outside the dancehall; and vines of blue passion flower that smelled like candied ginger and looked like ticking clocks. And: a carpet of the Califia black tulip, whose petals achieved a shade of black that had eluded hybridizers for centuries. In the early years of the 1960s the neighborhood of Sweet Auburn was the only place in the Western Hemisphere where you could find this tulip.&nbsp;</p>

Inside the Carousel Salon on Madison near 123rd, Melinda Feather was the most requested manicurist; whoever received this color found herself catapulted into a state of utter non-judgment, all the cattiness tweezed out overnight. Psychic pollution was cleared, inner space was put at ease. One was promptly irradiated with kindness toward one's sistren. It must be something about the hue saturation, everyone said. Then again, maybe it was just the fumes.</p>

They called her the Empress of Technicolor. In 1949, during a party at the Torino Club in Palm Springs, Maradi got into a tepid quarrel with her crumb-bum of a gigolo and in an attempt to orchestrate a dignified exit, Kobra threw on her fur coat only to realize it had turned, wholesale, into a new color.</p>
