<p align="left" class="style2">Shelly found a flower shop that gave out arrangements. Everyday she would walk to the florist and bring home fresh free flowers for the table by the dining room window. The table was oak and of slim portions, there was an oversize book with images from Ingmar Bergman films. The pollen would collect with the dust and Shelly would wipe the wood once a month with Pledge.</p>

<p align="left" class="style2">Tom has gotten into the habit of stealing diapers for his daughter. The family makes enough money but Tom does not like being wasteful. He has never spoken a word of this to his wife, Tina. Instead, Tom comes home from the store with a smile and while changing Tiffany's diaper he tells her how everything went down, ommitting only minor security details.</p>
<p align="center" class="style5">1.12.10</p>
<p align="left" class="style2">In the studio, while sampling the flute and bass line from Tower of Power's 'Sparkling In The Sand', Diamond D had a fierce addiction to chocolate.</p>

<p align="left" class="style2">Charlie liked to ride the back roads and listen to Quasimoto. One morning, at day&rsquo;s first light, the car hood split the fog and the tires slid across the dew just before greeting a 240 lb. buck. Quasi was saying, &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t gotta go away mad, girl. Just go away.&rdquo; Charlie was mouthing the words, as he looked at the corn ready for harvest.<br />
  My friend still takes to the back roads with confidence and chump change.</p>

<p align="left" class="style2">How legal is it to have your name changed for the public record? This is something that should be illegal forever. Think about it, do any of us really know who Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf is? </p>
<p align="center" class="style5">1.19.10</p>
<p align="left" class="style2">Crissy always told me she wasn&rsquo;t racist. But sometimes I wonder. We were listening to INI's 'Fakin' Jax' in her dorm room and she kept saying, &ldquo;Pete Rock&rsquo;s teeth are so white!&rdquo; over and over. </p>

<p align="left" class="style2">Todd loved the strip club. He always banged the strippers for free and that is why it was so fun for him. His friend, Ike, went with him to the club one night and kept asking him why he was reading that book and refusing to tip the girls. Todd said he&rsquo;d been there too many times and wanted to go home and read without that weird smell in the air.</p>

  She has a love for shopping that is hard to avoid. So, I have her meet me at the post-office. With bright shoes, the revolution begins. The walls stare down on us in repetition. Square following square. Her brown eyes stay floating. My neck is snug on her shoulder as we hug. I look out onto the street and a crowd begins to gather and shout.</p>

<p align="left" class="style2">Gary never came over late one night like he said he would. He sent me an email and I couldn&rsquo;t understand the gist. I think I made him happy but he said something to the effect of, Cindy&hellip;you----fail^^^at&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..love.</p>
