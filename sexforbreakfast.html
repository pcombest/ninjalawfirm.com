<p class="style10">&quot;I was greedy, hungry for men. The more the better. Father had a lot of she-goats but only one ram, In&aacute;cio. But I had plenty of billygoats and I let 'em mount me anywhere---on the stony ground, on the hillsides, down by the river, on the beach. That was the only pleasure a man could give me, just that and nothing else: to lie down on the ground and be laid. At the old man's table we always ate the same things: beans, manioc flour and jerky. The man who gave me a taste for fancy dishes, the kind you can never get enough of, was Lucas, and the classroom was Dr. Flugencio's bed.&quot;</p>

<p class="style10">He asked me when I was staring at it, &ldquo;Isn't it the  prettiest thing you've ever seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style10">Maybe I have a problem. It hits me when I'm about to go home  with a guy. I cross my fingers. God I hope it's big. It's fucked up that we  can't ask, as if men can't see the outline of our breasts in a tight shirt. I  like them that way. Maybe it's genetic, I've got Italian canals that go for  miles. One guy was so big I wanted to call the police. Shivering in fright  outside of the CVS pharmacy at 7:00 am about to buy Magnum XL's as if I could  take all that in. I was in such pain afterwards I held myself in the fetal  position for an entire day. Tommy. I was so scared when he called I put my  girlfriend on the phone. &ldquo;Sorry dude, she isn't here. Can I take a message?&rdquo;  No, I have the perfect one imagined in my brain. Cuz I've seen it. It's a  rarity. One so beautiful I can just stare at it, like it's its own entity. I  want to compliment it. Cook it dinner. Buy it flowers. Yes, I dehumanize the man  and humanize his staff. Like the men do for the ladies' ass, and breasts, and  their poetical place. Mine sings like a bird when it is filled up. It aches,  like howling, an owl on its own. Like when I was on acid and I swear I saw the  leaves on a plant fucking. It's natural law, the natural order of things. Girls  with glorious pussies deserve boys with glorious cocks.&nbsp; That's why they never show hard dicks on  cable; for some women it won't ever be big enough, and there goes our celebrity  fantasy. I think I saw Kevin Bacon's in <em>Wild Things</em>, it was pretty nice, but,  I've seen the perfect one already. I just have to wait 10 years until his brain  reaches the maturity of his dick. Yeah, I'll wait for it.</p>

<p class="style10">His Timex read 12:55:08.&nbsp;  That&rsquo;s four minutes and fifty-two seconds before lunch.&nbsp; He sat fidgeting in his cubicle &ndash; knees  bouncing, fingers dancing a jig.&nbsp; He had  no idea what to do with himself:&nbsp; the  sensation was overwhelming.&nbsp; And smelling  his mustache only made it worse; all he could smell was her.&nbsp; It was excruciating, bordering on torture &ndash;  but he liked it.&nbsp; And he was aching for  another round.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style10">Nine Hours Ago:</p>
<p class="style10">&ldquo;Fuck me.&nbsp;  Harder&hellip;harder!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style10">His cock was pole firm.&nbsp;  Drilling deep.&nbsp; Flirting with her spot.&nbsp; Her pussy was supreme: sweet, forever wet &ndash;  and tight enough.&nbsp; He looked into her  eyes, the picture of focus.&nbsp; If he came  at that very moment he was certain this would be the first and last time he&rsquo;d  ever have a fuck with her.&nbsp; So he turned  her over, just before the impulse arrived &ndash; he knew his body, needed it to  last.</p>
<p class="style10">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;&nbsp;  she moaned.</p>
<p class="style10">He didn&rsquo;t respond: he just grabbed her hair, pushed  deeper.&nbsp; Pacing, giving himself the  edge.&nbsp; Her ass went pink from the force,  slamming his thighs, willing him to go the distance.&nbsp; Then, he felt that tremble inside her.&nbsp; It was expanding, gradually flowing  throughout her entire being.&nbsp; She was  beginning to come &ndash;</p>
<p class="style10">Back to Present:</p>
<p class="style10">12:59:25.&nbsp; He surveyed  the office: colleagues were closing browsers, grabbing their coats, wrapping it  up.&nbsp; He put his computer to sleep.&nbsp; Stood up.&nbsp;  Stretched out the stress.&nbsp; Subway,  Baja Fresh &ndash; it didn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d sit  alone, thinking about her.&nbsp; He strode for  the door, spilled out into the hallway.&nbsp;  And there she was &ndash; his boss.&nbsp;  Fixing her hair, crossing her arms before the elevator.&nbsp; He moved beside her, watching the numbers  climb.&nbsp; The elevator DINGED.&nbsp; Slid open.&nbsp;  And before stepping in, she muttered:</p>
<p class="style10">&ldquo;Jesus, I can&rsquo;t get your smell off me.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style10"><span class="style11">copyright (NLF) rot 2010 _________________________________________________________________________ </span></p>
<p class="style10">After sex I like to listen to Tracy Chapman.&nbsp; <em>Talkin&rsquo; Bout A Revolution</em>, that&rsquo;s my favorite  song.&nbsp; What I like best is listening to  Tracy after something like anal sex.&nbsp; The  better the sex, the heavier the feeling, the better Tracy sounds to me  afterward. &nbsp;So that&rsquo;s my thing.&nbsp; That thing &ndash; like  listening to Chopin.&nbsp; I listen to Chopin when I take a shower.&nbsp; Tracy Chapman, Norah Jones, and Chopin &ndash;  that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m into.</p>
<p class="style10">Before getting into bed I try to think about how nice the  walls would look if they had women on them.&nbsp;  A bunch of women stacked together by the shoulders, lined up against the  walls of my room.&nbsp; Three and four of them  to a wall &ndash; all with their backs to me and with their hands bent back by their  arms and attached to their hips; their elbows reaching out like handles in the  subway.&nbsp; I want to grab ahold of one and  tug away, hang on by the corner like I did when I was younger.&nbsp; It would be a nice thing to see a wall lined  with girls &ndash; all the same size and shape, all of the curves rounded in their  particular place and perfectly matching the rest.&nbsp; Round is the word I&rsquo;ve often thought to  describe them &ndash; that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve seen them as I&rsquo;m lying down.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m lying.</p>
<p class="style10">I want you.&nbsp; Johnny  said: my dick wants you &ndash; Johnny from the party.&nbsp; He laughed when he saw I wrote that  down.&nbsp; Some people don&rsquo;t like when you  write about them.&nbsp; Other&rsquo;s love to read  about themselves, they like to be a muse.</p>
<p class="style10">Rita is a damn cunt.&nbsp;  She pulls her cunt from me and I have a look at it, wonderful as it is,  before it goes diving back underneath the covers.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s <em>her</em> thing.&nbsp; Mine is listening to good music.&nbsp; Hers is wrapping up her cunt when she&rsquo;s  finished.&nbsp; I have fun with Rita, pulling  back the covers and smelling the sheets where it&rsquo;s gooey and wet.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the wet spot, she says.&nbsp; Who knows what language it is but I swear  it&rsquo;s Italian and I smile thinking about how I sometimes confuse myself.&nbsp; Rita your cunt is a masterpiece, I say.&nbsp; I have a look at it.&nbsp; Oh, how it&rsquo;s diamond shaped.&nbsp; Rita, we like to do this don&rsquo;t we?&nbsp; Rita smiles and talks more of her sweet  Italian.&nbsp; She says: yes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s si.</p>

<p class="style10">Erotica was thrown before us like trash on the sidewalk. </p>
<p class="style10">We picked her up and asked where she wanted to go.</p>
<p class="style10">She said to the Palomar. </p>
<p class="style10">She knew someone at the desk that could get us a suite. </p>
<p class="style10">She said she liked the soap and shampoo they supply. Kiehl's.</p>
<p class="style10">She said she liked us even though she said she had never ridden in such a shitty Volvo.</p>
<p class="style10">She told me to park it in the garage and lit a cigarette as soon as we got out.</p>
<p class="style10">She walked behind us. Texting.</p>
<p class="style10">She wore the pants of a harem with laced heels. </p>
<p class="style10">We ordered cheeseburgers when we got to the room. </p>
<p class="style10">They came. We ate them. </p>

<p class="style18">The Battle</p>
<p class="style10">When you told me you had a girlfriend<br />
  I wanted you three-fold</p>
<p class="style10">I will break down your walls.</p>
<p class="style10">A battle to be won<br />
  The war scars would be magnificent<br />
  Another jewel for my collection<br />
  It's seduction<br />
  the smell of my scent<br />
  left on your pillow</p>
<p class="style10">You turn deaf to her moanings<br />
  So you can hear my sighs</p>
<p class="style10">Should I<br />
  Should I<br />
  put my pen to paper<br />
  No, for I know this game<br />
  Excited <br />
  because<br />
  my love controls you<br />
  leaving roots at the four corners <br />
  of your bed</p>
<p class="style10">You would risk death <br />
  to come<br />
  to my call</p>
<p class="style10">And I<br />
  I will never come first</p>
<p class="style10">Respect,<br />
  you have none for me truly<br />
  But, as well, I have none for you<br />
  Broken mirrors</p>
<p class="style10">I saw her,<br />
  not my insecurity that makes me doubt<br />
  because your lady<br />
  my love<br />
  Medusa's face<br />
  would cause the sun to hide behind the clouds<br />
  turn the whole world to stone</p>
<p class="style10">I know<br />
  It could be lovely<br />
  If<br />
  I never want to be your first</p>
<p class="style10">I can float on the high waves of your ocean<br />
  expecting nothing more than Demeter's tears</p>
<p class="style10">Make me a strong drink<br />
  Make your sex eyes from behind the bar<br />
  Lead me downstairs<br />
  Everyone knows<br />
  But of sex?<br />
  We deny it.<br />
  Carry me across the grease stained sidewalks<br />
  the blackened lakes of Tartarus<br />
  sinking into a pit of lust<br />
  We can't get out.<br />
  There is no way out.<br />
  Forever.</p>
<p class="style10">Push my face against the scaffold<br />
  the concrete<br />
  Let me guide your weapon<br />
  Inside<br />
  We don't give a fuck who sees<br />
  We don't mind if others stare.</p>
<p class="style10">My favorite kisser<br />
  passionate, bleeding hot<br />
  I leave my window open for you<br />
  Climb onto my rooftop, my thief<br />
  My murderer<br />
  Come and violate me<br />
  My door is open.</p>

<p class="style18">Ode to the Drug Dealer</p>
<p class="style10">I called you<br />
  Now I&rsquo;m waiting by my phone<br />
  How long <br />
  until I get my<br />
  Fix</p>
<p class="style10">My insides hurt<br />
  A little<br />
  Goodly<br />
  Red sheets</p>
<p class="style10">The Velvet Underground<br />
  Told me you would never be<br />
  On time.</p>
<p class="style10">Oh the phone<br />
  Yes come over<br />
  Come on<br />
  Over<br />
  No really sir, at this point<br />
  I shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay</p>
<p class="style10">Smoky <br />
  Ashes<br />
  Clouded<br />
  Dusty <br />
  Powdery<br />
  Remains<br />
  Smacking<br />
  Spanking<br />
  Puffing<br />
  Kissing</p>
<p class="style10">This drug<br />
  Your black eyes<br />
  They seem to be in a trance<br />
  Reflecting only what I want to see<br />
  What I want</p>
<p class="style10">More drugs<br />
  More fucking<br />
  We never go out<br />
  You like to be inside too much.<br />
  And I like it when you come inside.<br />
  Three more times we did it<br />
  In the span of a few hours<br />
  But it was a lifetime</p>
<p class="style10">Dealing it out to me<br />
  Like a deck of cards<br />
  Hit me<br />
  Tell me when I&rsquo;m going over<br />
  Put your dick upon the table<br />
  How much is it worth<br />
  And are you even selling?</p>
<p class="style10">Where did my time go with you?<br />
  Where did my life go with you?<br />
  Many years, we played this game<br />
  I couldn&rsquo;t see<br />
  Wavy hair<br />
  The smell of your shampoo.<br />
  You reminded me of Slater<br />
  Funny words<br />
  Fingering me while we listen<br />
  To jazz on the couch.<br />
  I fell in love with you then.<br />
  Watching you smoke<br />
  Cigarette <br />
  Ashes.<br />
  The haze<br />
  The foggy sky<br />
  It cloaked you.<br />
  I couldn&rsquo;t see the monster<br />
  Now married to your grand deception<br />
  So hard for me to drive<br />
  Your dick was really all I remember.</p>
<p class="style11">copyright (NLF) beaverhausen 2010 _____________________________________________________________
<p class="style10">I can get slain in public for talking about how much I like it from behind. <br />
His cock deep, with a tight pull to my hair and I'm golden. Golden - as in - I'm squirting so much pussy juice that guys be like, <em>Don't run out! How do I get more? Is the price going to go up? </em>Seriously, I can sell jars of the stuff.</p>
<p class="style10">Sometimes when I cum I think about that scene in <em>Slacker</em> where that dike is trying to sell a sample of Madonna's pap smear. I don't recall the dike having a set price or anything, just her trying to off it as if there should be a Christie's auctioneer over-her-shoulder, rambling and accepting calls for thousands of dollars.</p>
<p class="style10">I know my pussy is clean and I know the Ukrainian girl who does my line is somewhat of an architect. It really is satisfying not offering up any bullshit in the bedroom. Though, if some dick tries to enter me with a rubber, that shit won't fly.<br />
  <br />
Most girls flip their bangs or use KY. <em>The VIP list is long, the STD list is strong</em>.</p>
<p class="style10">Me? I don't have time for disease. My pussy is prolific.</p>
<p class="style11">copyright (NLF) pcp 2010 __________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p class="style10">This bitch was  finer than fine, feel me?&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I've seen fine, I ain't never - not  a day in my thirty-four years - set eyes on what this shorty was  bringing.&nbsp; I'm talking electric.&nbsp; Superhuman - fuck, <u>supernatural</u>,  man.&nbsp; Shit that makes you wonder - shit that makes you stop and  think.&nbsp; It was mystifying - indescribable.&nbsp; Face, lips, legs - of  course she had the package, have you been listening?&nbsp; I'm talking above  and beyond, off the charts-type shit.&nbsp; She had taste, too - you know those  curry-brown Superstars you can only cop online?&nbsp; With the white  shell-toe?&nbsp; She had a pair.&nbsp; I'm telling you, there was nothing wrong  with this broad.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
  And then there was that ass...<br />
  <br />
  It was...painful.&nbsp; Straight up - like it hurt  lookin' at it, but the last thing you're gonna do is stop.&nbsp; It was one of  the most beautiful things I ever seen - and she was wearing this dress with it  - where you could see just a little something underneath.&nbsp; I mean it was&nbsp;<br />
  <u>wild</u>,  man.&nbsp; You had to see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  So I hollered.&nbsp; Nothing fancy - real talk,  y'know?&nbsp; I couldn't even tell you what I said.&nbsp; I just spoke.&nbsp;  She was out of my league anyway - I had no business even trying with this  broad.&nbsp; Then, she try and put me in place, sayin' -<br />
  <br />
&quot;You gonna keep flirting, or you gonna get me  a size 7 in the new 95's?&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Right?&nbsp; Like bitch, I don't even know you,  but I'm still kinda buggin' cause of that ass so I'm just thinking  'okay.'&nbsp; 'It's aight' - 'that's cool.'&nbsp; 'She ain't interested' -  'what can I do?'&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  So I run back to stock, grab her size 7's, bring 'em  to the front.&nbsp; She's sitting down on one of the benches now, lookin'  everywhere but me.&nbsp; So I take a knee, open the box, take out the  95's.&nbsp; All the sudden I look up - yo, I can't even make this up - her legs  is wide open, like she wants me to see it.&nbsp; This girl still ain't looking  at me - she was starin' at the lights - who the fuck knows what she was starin'  at?&nbsp; Who cares?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  So I'm pretending like I don't see it, but I mean  she's&nbsp;<u>all</u>&nbsp;out - like every detail of that damn thing was  visible.&nbsp; So I just play it cool and fit her into the 95's.&nbsp; For  real, like it don't matter - oh it was straight.&nbsp; I mean, her joint was  maintained.&nbsp; You could tell she managed that shit regularly.&nbsp; Yeah,  it was legit.<br />
  <br />
  So meanwhile, I'm trying to keep it down,  y'know?&nbsp; But the longer I'm on the knee, the harder it's gonna be - and  I'm in the uniform, so you know I'ma be showing if I stand.&nbsp; So, check  this -<u> she</u>&nbsp;stands up.&nbsp; Starts walkin' in the 95's, seeing if  they fit.&nbsp; And me?&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;<u>still </u>on the knee so now I got a view of everything - front  and fuckin' back!&nbsp; This ass was no&nbsp;<em>joke</em>.&nbsp;  Seriously, she had a nigga wanting to cry it was so - it was divine.&nbsp; And  I just kept lookin' and it didn't matter that she wasn't lookin' back - she  knew what she was doing - she knew I was peepin'.<br />
  <br />
  After that?&nbsp; She sits down.&nbsp; Said she  wasn't really feelin' the 95's.&nbsp; I ain't fight - I didn't care.&nbsp; What  was I gonna say that was gonna changer her mind?&nbsp; She didn't like the  shoes.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  So she got back in her Superstars, left without a  word.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Not even a 'thank you.'&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
And that was it... </p>
<p class="style11">copyright (NLF) rot 2010 _________________________________________________________________________
<p class="style10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We sit in my office naked, buzzed on champagne, while she shows me pics from a Calvin Klein show, audition tapes a friend shot, a modeling portfolio, paparazzi photos of her at B-list events---the opening of a shoe store on Canon, a charity benefit at someone's home in Brentwood, standing with a group of girls at the Playboy Mansion at the Midsummer Night's Dream Party---and then always it seems we're back in the bedroom.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What do you want for Christmas?&quot; she asks.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This. You.&quot; I smile. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I want a part in your movie,&quot; she says. &quot;You know that.&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yeah?&quot; I ask, my hand tracing her thigh. &quot;<em>My</em> movie? Which part?&quot; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I want the part of Martina.&quot; She kisses me, her hand moving down to my cock, gripping it, releasing it, gripping it again.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And I'm going to try and get it for you.&quot;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pause is involuntary but she recovers in a second. &quot;<em>Try?</em>&quot;

<p class="style10">You are such a big shot business man.<br />
  You have a black leather briefcase.<br />
  You buy me everything I want, this princess lives in a  castle<br />
  And I wear dresses in white Victorian lace.</p>
<p class="style10">You're not the nicest man under the stars.<br />
  You intimidate everyone with a stare.<br />
  You should leave that behavior at the office.<br />
  And I should have been more cautious descending into  Moloch's lair.</p>
<p class="style10">You like to control your conquests.<br />
  Little women's bodies littered on your marble floor.<br />
  You like to dominate us in your bedroom.<br />
  But after a few nights with you, I just can't stand it  anymore.</p>
<p class="style10">When you're about to go I watch, I wait, to see it come.<br />
  It's a liquid creamy fountain, ascending into outer space.<br />
  But I cannot understand, I cannot comprehend, why you think  you have the right,<br />
  To shoot your load upon my face.</p>
<p class="style10">A pristine statue of beauty, this visage.<br />
  A face that would make Helen sigh.<br />
  You know that I wear I contacts.<br />
  Yet you persist and ejaculate near my eye.</p>

  The masochistic girl in me will always remain.<br />
  And I know you like to humiliate your victims.<br />

<p class="style10">If I feel pain, it should be in one spot,<br />
  Not my spine, not my throat, and for me, not my derriere.<br />
  Going into work with an irritated bloodshot eye,<br />
  Well my darling, that just ain't fair.</p>
<p class="style10">You can do that in a lady's mouth or inside that beret you  kind ones wear.<br />
  You can do that on a lady's breast or on her thighs.<br />
  In between her legs, if she doesn't hate you, there is a  tiny charming space.<br />
  But never, ever, my darling, on your life, shoot your load  upon this face.</p>

<p class="style10">I sank into the  sofa like it was made of marshmallow.&nbsp; My eyes slipped shut and I felt  that good feeling of sleep flooding my brain.&nbsp; My mouth started to open  and I was nearly asleep when I heard the sound of ice in a glass getting slowly  louder, footsteps coming near me.&nbsp; I looked over and there she was; naked  but for my silk robe tied loosely around her full hips.&nbsp; In her right hand  was a glass of some amber liquid.&nbsp; She stood over me and undid the robe  with her left hand, letting it fall around her feet.&nbsp; She turned away from  me slowly, bending at the waist ever so slightly.&nbsp; That ass.&nbsp; Like  fresh country bread, supple and firm, it stood close enough that I could see  the small blond hairs in the late-afternoon sun coming through the  blinds.&nbsp; Then I smelled the bourbon and felt the cool touch of the glass  as I took the drink from off her ass.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="style10">He, Jonathan Cunningham,  was suddenly tired of writing about himself. &nbsp;Specifically, he was tired  of the letter: I. &nbsp;As he sat something turned in his stomach and reminded  him of a bad experience.&nbsp; The page was covered - and so he&nbsp;threw it  in the fire and watched it burn.&nbsp; He&nbsp;had pulled it; it making  that&nbsp;spinning sound,&nbsp;out of the typewriter before crumpling and  flinging it&nbsp;into the fireplace. &nbsp;He stood up from his old leather  chair next to the oak desk; he had all those things that writers have when they  read books.</p>
<p class="style10">Jonathan went upstairs  because upstairs was Sonja and Shannon, and Sonja needed to be&nbsp;tended to.  &nbsp;Normally he would have left her be and crawled into bed before sun-up, or  fallen asleep on the sofa downstairs. &nbsp;But tonight he had thrown his work  in the fire, retiring early for the evening. &nbsp;Shannon could be a bother at  times - he thought so - sometimes she would come down and lay against him on  the sofa. &nbsp;Sonja didn't do this; Sonja was all of the things he liked -  and Shannon was all of the rest. &nbsp;There had been many questions before:  what about the rest, what about the other things? &nbsp;Shannon was the answer  to those questions.</p>
<p class="style10">On this night - because  this was not a night like the others - he found the two girls, upstairs,  together in bed. This on its own was not unusual. What surprised Jonathan this night was a painting, a Cy  Twombly, which now hung on the far wall - above the bed. &nbsp;He had seen the  painting once before, he couldn't be sure when, but it had not been in his  room.</p>
<p class="style10">-Where did you get that?<br />
  -We stole it, said  Sonja.<br />
  -From where?<br />
  -From a home - during a  party. &nbsp;We stole it together. &nbsp;We were together when we took it.</p>
<p class="style10">It was a nice painting -  lots of scribbling and plenty of words and streaks of color. &nbsp;He stared at  it for a while and the girls let him take it in. &nbsp;They did not talk nor  wiggle a limb. It would have been nice of them, but this was fairly  routine behavior; the girls were used to giving him the time he needed to play  with the things around him. &nbsp;When he was done flirting with the different  stories in his head: he imagined the girls stealing such a painting, how they  must have looked doing so, the fact neither presumably knew the name of the  artist made him smile, and how that might make the collector who no longer had  it on his wall smile - he asked the girls to roll over. &nbsp;Sonja was first.  &nbsp;She liked to be first - like an athlete who cares about winning.  &nbsp;Once on her stomach she arched up her hips, and Shannon crawled on top of  her, lying her stomach on Sonja's back.</p>
<p class="style10">Jonathan stood as he  was. &nbsp;He melted within the frame of the door, both Sonja's and Shannon's  asses raised perfectly in the air  - and then there was the freshly  added Twombly on the wall raised slightly in the background behind the two  asses. &nbsp;He switched the focus in his eyes; he switched from the two girls  to the Twombly and back again to the girls. &nbsp;He did so three more times -  each time thinking of how similar they looked.</p>

<p><span class="style10">Just got back from the coffee shop.&nbsp; I believe I counted five girls waiting in line - three in black leggings, one in gym shorts, the other in blue jeans.&nbsp; Collectively in the 7-9 range.&nbsp; All appealingly thin and fit, save for the girl in the blue jeans: a full-bodied redhead.&nbsp; Her arms could have used some toning, but everything else was tip-top - especially her ass.&nbsp; Her ass?&nbsp; Legendary.&nbsp; A staggering work of spherical perfection not even the Greeks could envision. &nbsp; Now with all that candy in the room I'm thinking to myself, which one?&nbsp; Which one do I want to taste the most?&nbsp; Naturally, knowing where my priorities stand, you'd probably assume the redhead.&nbsp; And your assumption would be incorrect.&nbsp; My friends, the answer is simple, logical, authentic: all five.&nbsp; And you know why?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  Ass is ass.</span>
