  <p align="center" class="style5">11.19.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style13">One of the secret pleasures afforded by the walks through the Barrio G<em>&ograve;</em>tico in Barcelona is visiting the secondhand bookstores (to my mind the best stocked in the world), whose owners still preserve that subtle expertise, rewarding intuition, and canny knowledge which are the virtues of the authentic bookseller, a species well on its way to imminent extinction.</p>

  <p align="center" class="style5">11.23.10</p>
  <p align="left">Jos&eacute;  is sitting outside his bungalow at the Chateau Marmont, getting head, with one hand holding a Wild Turkey and the other a book by Cort&aacute;zar, looking through his Ray-Ban sunglasses, half-reading <em>A Small Story Tending To Illustrate The Uncertainty Of The Stability Within Which We Like To Believe We Exist, Or Laws Could Give Ground To The Exceptions, Unforseen Disasters, Or Improbabilities, And I Want To See You There</em>, while occasionally squinting into the neighboring  window to see election results and laugh  at all of the warmongers and commercials in the distance. </p>

  <p align="center" class="style5">11.24.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2"> Anyone who doesn't read Cort&aacute;zar is doomed. <br />
    Not to read him is a serious invisible disease which in time can have terrible consequences. Something similar to a man who has never tasted peaches. He would quietly become sadder . . . and, probably, little by little, he would lose his hair. </p>
  <p align="right" class="style2">-&nbsp;<em>Pablo Neruda</em></p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">11.29.10</p>
  <p align="left">Johan Borg  is a painter who is regularly approached by odd and suspicious people. He confides to his young, pregnant wife Alma  that he believes them to be demons, and that his insomnia is growing worse. On the nights when Johan can't sleep, Alma stays awake by his side through the nights, especially during the&nbsp;<em>vargtimmen</em>&nbsp;(&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour_of_the_wolf" title="Hour of the wolf" target="_blank">The Hour of the Wolf</a>&quot;), during which, Johan says, most births and deaths occur. Johan begins to give names to the figures who approach him, including the Bird-Man, the Insects, the Meat-Eaters, the Schoolmaster (with pointers in his trousers), and The Lady With a Hat. Throughout the film, Alma expresses her belief that two people who love each other, and spend their lives with each other, will eventually become alike. (See&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(film)" title="Persona (film)" target="_blank">Persona</a>.)</p>
  <p align="left">It is implied to the audience that these figures represent Johan's shames, traumas, and vices. Johan's wife talks about wanting to grow old with him, and that night, a 216-year-old woman approaches him, taunting him about age. In one scene, he recounts to his wife meeting a small boy tanning himself on a rock. As the nude boy approached Johan, he &quot;realized&quot; it was a demon representing homosexuality (and sexual experimentation in his youth), and violently smashed the child's face against a stone before tossing him into the ocean to drown. Alma reacts to the story with shock, and sinks into despair. Johan tries to persuade her to leave so he might kill himself, but the couple are approached by a baron, von Merkens, who lives in a nearby castle. The painter and his wife visit them and their surreal household: a castle, where Johan's ex-girlfriend Veronica lies waiting on a table. Swarms of men dress Johan in make-up and women's clothing in preparation for a sexual encounter with her, while Veronica hands Alma her husband's diary and tells her &quot;I have bought myself a sizeable stake in your husband.&quot; Veronica taunts her by showing her bruises on her pelvis, &quot;perpetual sources of reinvogarated enthusiasm&quot;.</p>
