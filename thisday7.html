<p align="center" class="style1">This day in rap history...</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.1.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">Alone with books. /////////////me</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.2.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">DO NOT DROP THE CHALICE</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.5.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Occassionaly I have something to speak about, a story from childhood or an attempt to understand perspective. But not that often. I would rather listen to her talk.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.6.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">The moon appears tacked to the navy sky. The writer is trapped in his cardigan of the same color (literally trapped, can't get out). A chubby kid is playing in a pit of balls, all navy blue (tarp, balls, net, screws, etc.). His shirt has a mustard stain on it. He buries himself in the balls and calls for his mom who is sitting on a bench next to her navy purse, wishing for something brighter (a yellow or royal blue bag), talking on a black cell phone.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.7.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">On the wooden deck. The Atlantic crashes into the sand. The sun slides under the waves. Down the path there is a pond. Disguised by the forest. It is dusk. You walk hand-in-hand until you find yourself wading in the fresh water. You kiss him on the cheek, he kisses you on the cheek. He takes your shirt off, you take his shirt off. You both step back. Drop your shorts. Giggles. Smile. He comes closer. Guides his hand across the scar on your stomach. You suck in, take his hand and lead him into the bath.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.8.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">You loved me. And your lies had their own probity.<br />
    There was a truth in every falsehood.<br />
    Your love went far beyond any possible<br />
    boundary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as no one else's could.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">Your love seemed to last even longer <br />
    than time itself. Now you wave your hand---<br />
    and suddenly your&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love for me is over!<br />
    That is the truth in five words.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.9.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Manuel Torre (1878-1933) was one of the first cantaores to sing cante jondo in a natural voice---from the chest, not from the throat. When Lorca met him in December 1927, he heard Torre say &quot;What you must search for, and find, is the black torso of the Pharoah.&quot; (Torre was a Gypsy and thus thought himself of Egyptian origin.)</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.12.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">Paul would polish his shoes, but who'd listen?</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.13.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">No MJ.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style8">If they say why, why?<br />
    Tell em' that is human nature.<br />
    If they say why, why?<br />
    Tell em' that is human nature.<br />
    Why, why does he do me that way?<br />
    I like livin' this way, I like lovin' this way.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style8">Looking out across the morning,<br />
    The city's heart begins to beat.<br />
    Reaching out, I touch her shoulder<br />
    I'm dreaming of the street.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.14.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">The best books are left unfinished. </p>
  <p align="center" class="style2">She told me she wanted it back.<br />
    I gave it away.<br />
    Get it back.<br />
    Warm the water and let me know when it's ready.<br />
    No shower tonite?<br />
    No, I need to soak.<br />
    Doesn't make a drop of sense.</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.15.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Drake called the NLF office this morning asking for the baddest bitch. Said he wanted to have her represent all legality on the next album.<br />
    Buttersworth told him we would shut it down, down, down.<br />
    He asked if she knew about the article where Prince professes, &quot;the internet is completely over.&quot; She did. <br />
    Drake said, &quot;I'm trying to get my name off the blogs.&quot; Then he started singing into his bluetooth,</p>
  <p align="left" class="style8"> Put those fucking heels on and work it girl&nbsp;<br />
    Let that mirror show you what your doing&nbsp;<br />
    Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious&nbsp;<br />
    like somebody's taking pictures </p>
  <p align="left" class="style2"> Buttersworth said, &quot;Use the rotary connection, hun.&quot;<br />
  Six million dollar phone call.<br />

  <p align="center" class="style5">7.19.10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">The pavement on the sidewalk is broken. Deborah speeds over the jutting cement on her way to meet Emory. She plans to cheat on her boyfriend with him. Neighborhood women pushing strollers struggle due to exposed tree roots. Deborah carries a bag of clothes and has a credit card in her pocket. Her bank is holding her money and she wants to get fucked. I'm going to chime in with my own voice here and say, &quot;I hope Deborah trips on a tree root and lands face first on the pavement in front of a stroller.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center" class="style5">7.20.10</p>
  <p align="center" class="style11">SUICIDE NOTE #10</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">Been drunk all day. So what! I've lost my happiness--gone in a troika careering into silver mist. Had laid down with a woman whose bosoms resembled an accordion. The hour came, you left the house forever. I hurled the ring at your swollen ass. You laid your life in the hands of another, and I forgot your cheekbone's lovely arc. I am nailed to the bar with liquour. </p>

  <p align="left" class="style2">An important day not to forget in world history. July, 1991. Chill Wave. All noted rappers and producers were locked into a country music  hot box and exterminated. This tragedy brought about a new Don Juan meets Pedro Paramo style of music. People were celebrating the massacre at the clubs for a month afterward. MJ wrote a song called <em>Blood On The Dancefloor</em> in homage. The spiritual cleansing supplied us with gangster rap, but the nation seems to try hard to forget about this mass execution. Char-Broiled Rapper Month.</p>
