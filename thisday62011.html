  <p class="style21">Con la guitarra en la mano<br />
    Ni las moscas se me arriman,<br />
    Naides me pone el pie encima,<br />
    Y cuando el pecho se entona,<br />
    Hago gemir a la prima<br />
    Y llorar a la bordona.<br />
  <br />
    Yo soy toro en mi rodeo<br />
    Y torazo en rodeo ajeno;<br />
    Siempre me tuve por g&uuml;eno<br />
    Y si me quieren probar,<br />
    Salgan otros a cantar<br />
    Y veremos qui&eacute;n es menos.<br />
  <br />
    No me hago al lao de la g&uuml;eya<br />
    Aunque vengan degollando,<br />
    Con los blandos yo soy blando<br />
    Y soy duro con los duros,<br />
    Y ninguno en un apuro<br />
    Me ha visto andar tutubiando.</p>

    no one sets his foot on me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and when I sing full from my heart <br />
    I make the top string moan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the low string cry.<br />
  <br />
    I'm the bull in my own herd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a braver bull in the next one;<br />
    I always thought I was pretty good,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if anyone else wants to try me <br />
    let them come out and sing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we'll see who comes off worst.<br />
  <br />
    I don't move off the track&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even though they're out cutting throats:<br />
    with the soft, I am soft,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I am hard with the hard, <br />
    and in a time of peril,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no one	has seen me hesitate.</span></p>

  <p align="left" class="style25">SUN AND SKULL</p>
  <p align="left" class="style25">The other day I was at the beach and I thought I saw a dead body. I was sitting on one of the benches along Blanes's Paseo Maritimo, brushing the sand off my feet, waiting for my son to brush the sand off his feet so we could go home, when I thought I saw a body. I got up and looked again: an old woman was sitting under a beach umbrella reading a book and next to her was a man, the same age or maybe a few years older, in a tiny bathing suit, lying in the sun. This man's head was like a skull. I saw him and said to myself that he would soon be dead. And I realized that his old wife, reading peacefully, knew it too. She was sitting in a beach chair with a blue canvas back. A small but comfortable chair. He was stretched out on the sand, only his head in the shade. On his face I thought I glimpsed a frown of contentment, or maybe he was just sleeping while his wife read. He was very tan. Skeletal but tan. They were tourists from up north. Possibly German or English. Maybe Dutch or Belgian. It doesn't really matter. As the seconds went by, his face looked more and more skull-like. And only then did I realize how eagerly, how recklessly, he was exposing himself to the sun. He wasn't using sunscreen. And he knew he was dying and he was lying in the sun on purpose like a person saying goodbye to someone very dear. The old tourist was bidding farewell to the sun and to his own body and to his old wife sitting beside him. It was a sight to see, something to admire. It wasn't a dead body lying there on the sand, but a man. And what courage, what gallantry.</p>

  <p align="center" class="style5">6.10.11</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">We wish to express our significant concern at the distorted and offensive historical analogy used by the United States in this case when it compared the first &quot;Seminole War&quot; of 1817-18 to the terrorism of Al Qaeda. The United States cites the Ambrister and Arbuthnot incident, where General Andrew Jackson summarily executed two British subjects who were trading with Seminole Indians:</p>
  <p align="left" class="style23">Ambrister and Arbuthnot, both British subjects without any duty or allegiance to the United States, were tried and punished for conduct amounting to aiding the enemy... They were assisting unlawful hostilities by the Seminoles and their allies... Not only was the Seminole belligerency unlawful, but, much like modern-day Al Qaeda, the very way in which the Seminoles waged war against U.S. targets itself violated the customs and usages of war.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style2">This is an astonishing statement of revisionist history. General Jackson was ordered by President Monroe to lead a campaign against Seminoles and Creek Indians in Georgia. The politically ambitious Jackson used these orders as an excuse to invade Spanish-held Florida and begin an illegal war, burning entire Indian villages in a campaign of extermination. The Seminole efforts to defend themselves from an invading genocidal army could be termed an &quot;unlawful belligerency&quot; only by the most jingoistic military historian. General Jackson narrowly escaped censure in the U.S. Congress, was condemned in the international community, and his historical reputation was stained with dishonor. That the United States would reach for such an offensive legal precedent in the present era calls into question the reasoning and judgment of those who are representing the United States in this case.  </p>

So long as the writer is a woman who was once a whore and is moderately wealthy in her old age. So long as the author of the tome in question has lived a remarkable life.</p>

<p align="left" class="style25">...it's also true that a writer's homeland isn't his language or isn't only his language but the people he loves. And sometimes a writer's homeland isn't the people he loves but his memory. And other times a writer's only homeland is his steadfastness and his courage. In fact, a writer can have many homelands, and sometimes the identity of that homeland depends greatly on what he's writing at the moment. It's possible to have many homelands, it occurs to me now, but only one passport, and that passport is obviously the quality of one's writing. Which doesn't mean writing well, because anyone can do that, but writing incredibly well, and not even that, because anyone can write incredibly well. So what is top-notch writing? The same thing it has always been: the ability to peer into the darkness, to leap into the void, to know that literature is basically a dangerous undertaking. The ability to sprint along the edge of the precipice: to one side the bottomless abyss and to the other the faces you love, the smiling faces you love, and books and friends and food. And the ability to accept what you find, even though it may be heavier than the stones over the graves of all dead writers. Literature, as an Andalusian folk singer would put it, is danger.</p>
